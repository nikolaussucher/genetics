# Classical Genetics {-}

[Genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics) is, generally, the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity. In the first four lab sessions of this course, we will study classical genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_genetics). This is the oldest form of genetics that began with [Gregor Mendel's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel) experiments that formulated and defined a fundamental biological concept now referred to as Mendelian Inheritance. In the second part of this course,  we will learn and apply some of the fundamental techniques of [molecular genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_genetics).

Classical genetics is the part of genetics that is about the transmission of genetic traits via the acts of [reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction). The process by which characteristics are passed down from parents to their offspring is called heredity. In the sense of classical genetics, variation is known as the lack of resemblance in related individuals and can be categorized as discontinuous or continuous. The [phenotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype) is a general term that defines an individual's visible, physical traits. The [genotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype) of an offspring is known as its genetic makeup.

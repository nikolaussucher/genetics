# Molecular Genetics {-}

In the remaining 8 laboratory sessions of this course, we will learn and apply some of the fundamental techniques of molecular biology and genetics. Specifically, we will clone a portion of a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene from plants, insert this gene fragment into a plasmid vector, and analyze the sequences of resulting clones using bioinformatics.

[Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate_dehydrogenase) (abbreviated as GAPDH or less commonly as G3PDH) (EC 1.2.1.12) is an enzyme of ~37kDa that catalyzes the sixth step of glycolysis and thus serves to break down glucose for energy and carbon molecules. In addition to this long established metabolic function, GAPDH has recently been implicated in several non-metabolic processes, including transcription activation, initiation of apoptosis, ER to Golgi vesicle shuttling, and fast axonal, or axoplasmic transport.

Because the GAPDH gene is often stably and constitutively expressed at high levels in most tissues and cells, it is considered a housekeeping gene. For this reason, GAPDH is commonly used by biological researchers as a loading control for western blot and as a control for qPCR. Plants have multiple GAPDH genes; the specific ones that have been selected for cloning are the GAPC genes.

While we will chose and provide the plants for these experiments, all reagents will be provided in form of ready made "kits. In the early days of molecular biology, researchers had to prepare all required materials themselves including the laborious purification of enzymes. Today, virtually any reagent that is required can be purchased "off-the-shelf", prepackaged and ready to use from a great number of suppliers. One of the oldest companies specialized in supplying materials for life science research laboratories are the [BioRad Laboratories Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio-Rad_Laboratories), which developed the curriculum for these experiments and supplies the materials under Bio-Rad Explorer~TM~ Cloning and Sequencing Explorer Series.

The steps in this project to clone and analyze plant GAPC genes (and the corresponding chapters) are:

1. Identify the plant or plants to be studied and extract the gDNA (DNA Extraction chapter).
2. Amplify a portion of the GAPC gene using PCR (PCR chapter).
3. Assess the results of PCR, purify the PCR products and perform nested PCR (Nested PCR chapter).
4. Ligate (insert) the GAPC gene fragment into a plasmid vector and transform bacteria with the plasmid (Ligation and Transformation chapter).
5. Isolate the plasmid from the bacteria and confirm the presence of the insert by restriction enzyme digestion (Plasmid Purification chapter).
6. Prepare plasmid for DNA sequencing and send to a facility for sequencing (Sequencing chapter).
7. Obtain the sequence of the cloned GAPC gene fragment and analyze the cloned gene using bioinformatics (Bioinformatics chapter).

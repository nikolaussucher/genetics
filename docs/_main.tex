\item
  NO FOOD, BEVERAGES, GUM, in the labs. Cell phone usage is also prohibited in the lab.
\item
  Conduct yourself in a responsible manner at all times in the lab. Horseplay, pranks and practical jokes are prohibited and will not be tolerated. If you participate in inappropriate behavior the INSTRUCTOR HAS THE RIGHT TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE THE lab.
\item
  Students cannot be in the lab without an instructor present.
\item
  Read all lab procedures, precautions, and equipment instructions thoroughly before each lab. Follow all written and verbal instructions carefully. Perform only those experiments authorized by the instructor. If during the lab you don't understand, stop and ask the instructor before proceeding. Never do anything in the lab that is outside of your instructors directions or that is not in your lab procedure.
\item
  Do not begin lab activities; touch any chemicals or equipment until you are instructed to do so.
\item
  Work areas should be kept organized and clean at all times. Only necessary items (lab notebook, worksheets, etc.) should be on your workbench. Backpacks and purses must be stored under the benches or against the walls. CLEAN ALL OF YOUR WORK SURFACES AND EQUIPMENT AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT. Safely dispose of waste in its proper container and place glassware in the grey bins by the sink. DO NOT STACK GLASSWARE. If the bin is full ask the instructor for another bin.
\item
  Keep aisles clear. Push lab stools under the lab benches when not in use.
\item
  Know where the safety equipment is and how to use it. This includes the first aid kit, eyewash station, safety shower, fire extinguisher, and fire blanket. Know the location of the fire alarm, and emergency phone. In the event of a fire drill during lab time containers must be closed, gas valves off, fume hood, and all electrical equipment must be turned off.
\item
  NEVER DISPOSE OF ANYTHING IN THE SINK. All materials are to be disposed of in the proper hazardous waste containers with the assistance of the instructor. All waste containers must be closed and placed inside a secondary containment bin.
\item
  As classes in these labs use toxic chemicals, keep your hands away from your face, eyes and mouth while working in the lab. Always wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap before leaving the lab to prevent injury or illness. This is part of proper lab procedure.
\item
  Students are not permitted in the prep room areas (between the lab rooms).
\item
  Handle all living organisms used for lab experiments in a respectful, humane manner.
\item
  Microscopes must be properly cleaned, the electrical cords properly wrapped, and returned to their places with their protective covers.
\end{enumerate}

Disposal of all hazardous waste is ONLY to be handled by the instructor and in a manner consistent with federal, state and local hazardous waste disposal regulations. Organic solvents are never to be disposed of down the sink; receptacles will be provided as needed for their collection. All hazardous chemical substances must be placed in the appropriate type of container and labeled with chemical, name and date, sealed and placed upright in a gray plastic bin.

\chapter*{Classical Genetics}\label{classical-genetics}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Classical Genetics}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics}{Genetics} is, generally, the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity. In the first four lab sessions of this course, we will study \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_genetics}{classical genetics}. This is the oldest form of genetics that began with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel}{Gregor Mendel's} experiments that formulated and defined a fundamental biological concept now referred to as Mendelian Inheritance. In the second part of this course, we will learn and apply some of the fundamental techniques of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_genetics}{molecular genetics}.

Classical genetics is the part of genetics that is about the transmission of genetic traits via the acts of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction}{reproduction}. The process by which characteristics are passed down from parents to their offspring is called heredity. In the sense of classical genetics, variation is known as the lack of resemblance in related individuals and can be categorized as discontinuous or continuous. The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype}{phenotype} is a general term that defines an individual's visible, physical traits. The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype}{genotype} of an offspring is known as its genetic makeup. Mendel was the first to systematically investigate how certain well-defined traits are transmitted from parents to offspring. Mendel's conclusions were largely ignored by the vast majority of scientists at the time. In 1900, however, his work was ``re-discovered'' by three European scientists, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_de_Vries}{Hugo de Vries}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Correns}{Carl Correns}, and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_von_Tschermak}{Erich von Tschermak}. In 1905, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Johannsen}{Wilhelm Johannsen} introduced the term \emph{gene} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bateson}{William Bateson} the term \emph{genetics}. Our understanding of what a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene\#Discovery_of_discrete_inherited_units}{\emph{gene}} is has undergone quite a bit of change. Currently, genes are considered to be pieces of DNA that contain information for synthesis of ribonuclec acids (RNAs) that can be directly functional or serve as the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function.

\hypertarget{mitosis-and-meiosis}{%
\chapter{Mitosis and Meiosis}\label{mitosis-and-meiosis}}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis}{Mitosis} is the part of the cell cycle when replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei. In general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is preceded by the S stage of interphase (during which the DNA is replicated) and is often accompanied or followed by cytokinesis, which divides the cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic (M) phase of an animal cell cycle (the division of the mother cell into two daughter cells genetically identical to each other).
The process of mitosis is divided into stages corresponding to the completion of one set of activities and the start of the next. These stages are prophase, pro-metaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis}{Meiosis} is a specialized type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, creating four haploid cells, each genetically distinct from the parent cell that gave rise to them. This process occurs in all sexually reproducing single-celled and multicellular eukaryotes, including animals, plants, and fungi. Errors in meiosis resulting in aneuploidy are the leading known cause of miscarriage and the most frequent genetic cause of developmental disabilities.
In meiosis, DNA replication is followed by two rounds of cell division to produce four daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the original parent cell. The two meiotic divisions are known as Meiosis I and Meiosis II. Before meiosis begins, during S phase of the cell cycle, the DNA of each chromosome is replicated so that it consists of two identical sister chromatids, which remain held together through sister chromatid cohesion. This S-phase can be referred to as ``premeiotic S-phase'' or ``meiotic S-phase''. Immediately following DNA replication, meiotic cells enter a prolonged G2-like stage known as meiotic prophase. During this time, homologous chromosomes pair with each other and undergo genetic recombination, a programmed process in which DNA is cut and then repaired, which allows them to exchange some of their genetic information. A subset of recombination events results in crossovers, which create physical links known as chiasmata (singular: chiasma, for the Greek letter Chi (X)) between the homologous chromosomes. In most organisms, these links are essential to direct each pair of homologous chromosomes to segregate away from each other during Meiosis I, resulting in two haploid cells that have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. During Meiosis II, the cohesion between sister chromatids is released and they segregate from one another, as during mitosis. In some cases, all four of the meiotic products form gametes such as sperm, spores, or pollen. In female animals, three of the four meiotic products are typically eliminated by extrusion into polar bodies, and only one cell develops to produce an ovum.
Because the number of chromosomes is halved during meiosis, gametes can fuse (i.e.~fertilization) to form a diploid zygote that contains two copies of each chromosome, one from each parent. Thus, alternating cycles of meiosis and fertilization enable sexual reproduction, with successive generations maintaining the same number of chromosomes. For example, diploid human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes including 1 pair of sex chromosomes (46 total), half of maternal origin and half of paternal origin. Meiosis produces haploid gametes (ova or sperm) that contain one set of 23 chromosomes. When two gametes (an egg and a sperm) fuse, the resulting zygote is once again diploid, with the mother and father each contributing 23 chromosomes. This same pattern, but not the same number of chromosomes, occurs in all organisms that utilize meiosis.

\section{Chromosomes}\label{chromosomes}}

A \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome}{chromosome} is a DNA molecule with part or all of the genetic material (genome) of an organism. Most eukaryotic chromosomes include packaging proteins which, aided by chaperone proteins, bind to and condense the DNA molecule to prevent it from becoming an unmanageable tangle. The word chromosome comes from the Greek χρῶμα (chroma, ``colour'') and σῶμα (soma, ``body''), describing their strong staining by particular dyes. The term was coined by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Wilhelm_Gottfried_von_Waldeyer-Hartz}{Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz}, referring to the term chromatin, which was introduced by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walther_Flemming}{Walther Flemming}.

Chromosomes are normally visible under a light microscope only when the cell is undergoing the metaphase of cell division (where all chromosomes are aligned in the center of the cell in their condensed form). Before this happens, every chromosome is copied once (S phase), and the copy is joined to the original by a centromere, resulting either in an X-shaped structure (Figure \ref{fig:karyo}) if the centromere is located in the middle of the chromosome or a two-arm structure if the centromere is located near one of the ends. The original chromosome and the copy are now called sister chromatids. During metaphase the X-shape structure is called a metaphase chromosome. In this highly condensed form chromosomes are easiest to distinguish and study. In animal cells, chromosomes reach their highest compaction level in anaphase during segregation.

Chromosomal recombination during meiosis and subsequent sexual reproduction play a significant role in genetic diversity. If these structures are manipulated incorrectly, through processes known as chromosomal instability and translocation, the cell may undergo mitotic catastrophe and die. Mutations in the cell can allow it to inappropriately evade apoptosis and lead to the progression of cancer.

Some use the term chromosome in a wider sense, to refer to the individualized portions of chromatin in cells, either visible or not under light microscopy. Others use the concept in a narrower sense, to refer to the individualized portions of chromatin during cell division, visible under light microscopy due to high condensation.

The prokaryotes -- bacteria and archaea -- typically have a single circular chromosome, but many variations exist. The chromosomes of most bacteria can range in size from only 130,000 base pairs in the endosymbiotic bacteria \emph{Candidatus Hodgkinia cicadicola} to more than 14,000,000 base pairs in the soil-dwelling bacterium \emph{Sorangium cellulosum}. Spirochaetes of the genus \emph{Borrelia} are a notable exception to this arrangement, with bacteria such as \emph{Borrelia burgdorferi}, the cause of Lyme disease, containing a single linear chromosome.

Chromosomes in eukaryotes are composed of chromatin fiber. Chromatin fiber is made of nucleosomes (histone octamers with part of a DNA strand attached to and wrapped around it). Chromatin fibers are packaged by proteins into a condensed structure called chromatin. Chromatin contains the vast majority of DNA and a small amount inherited maternally, can be found in the mitochondria. Chromatin is present in most cells, with a few exceptions, for example, red blood cells.

Chromatin allows the very long DNA molecules to fit into the cell nucleus. During cell division chromatin condenses further to form microscopically visible chromosomes. The structure of chromosomes varies through the cell cycle. During cellular division chromosomes are replicated, divided, and passed successfully to their daughter cells so as to ensure the genetic diversity and survival of their progeny. Chromosomes may exist as either duplicated or unduplicated. Unduplicated chromosomes are single double helixes, whereas duplicated chromosomes contain two identical copies (called chromatids or sister chromatids) joined by a centromere. Eukaryotes possess multiple large linear chromosomes contained in the cells' nucleus. Each chromosome has one centromere, with one or two arms projecting from the centromere, although, under most circumstances, these arms are not visible as such. In addition, most eukaryotes have a small circular mitochondrial genome, and some eukaryotes may have additional small circular or linear cytoplasmic chromosomes.Eukaryotes (cells with nuclei such as those found in plants, fungi, and animals) possess multiple large linear chromosomes contained in the cell's nucleus. Each chromosome has one centromere, with one or two arms projecting from the centromere, although, under most circumstances, these arms are not visible as such. In addition, most eukaryotes have a small circular mitochondrial genome, and some eukaryotes may have additional small circular or linear cytoplasmic chromosomes.

In the nuclear chromosomes of eukaryotes, the uncondensed DNA exists in a semi-ordered structure, where it is wrapped around histones (structural proteins), forming a composite material called chromatin.

Chromosomes in humans are divided into two types: autosomes (body chromosome(s)) and allosome (sex chromosome(s)). Certain genetic traits are linked to a person's sex and are passed on through the sex chromosomes. The autosomes contain the rest of the genetic hereditary information. All act in the same way during cell division. Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes), giving a total of 46 per cell. In addition to these, human cells have many hundreds of copies of the mitochondrial genome.

\hypertarget{karyotypes}{%
\section{Karyotypes}\label{karyotypes}}

A \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype}{karyotype} is the number and appearance of chromosomes in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell. The term is also used for the complete set of chromosomes in a
species or in an individual organism and for a test that detects this
complement or measures the number. The name was coined by the German anatomist, Heinrich von Waldeyer in 1888. It is New Latin from Ancient Greek κάρυον karyon, ``kernel'', ``seed'', or ``nucleus'', and τύπος typos, ``general form'').

Karyotypes describe the chromosome count of an organism and what these chromosomes look like under a light microscope. Attention is paid to their length, the position of the centromeres, banding pattern, any differences between the sex chromosomes, and any other physical characteristics. The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of cytogenetics.

The study of whole sets of chromosomes is sometimes known as karyology. The chromosomes are depicted (by rearranging a photomicrograph) in a standard format known as a karyogram or idiogram: in pairs, ordered by size and position of centromere for chromosomes of the same size as shown in Figure \ref{fig:karyo}.



\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{./figures/karyotyping/human_male_karyotype} 

}

\caption{\href{https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NHGRI_human_male_karyotype.png}{Karyogram of human male using Giemsa staining}}\label{fig:karyo}
\end{figure}

The basic number of chromosomes in the somatic cells of an individual or a species is called the somatic number and is designated 2n. In the germ-line (the sex cells) the chromosome number is n (humans: n = 23). Thus, in humans 2n = 46.

So, in normal diploid organisms, autosomal chromosomes are present in two copies. There may, or may not, be sex chromosomes. Polyploid cells have multiple copies of chromosomes and haploid cells have single copies.

The study of karyotypes is important for cell biology and genetics, and the results may be used in evolutionary biology (karyosystematics) and medicine. Karyotypes can be used for many purposes; such as to study chromosomal aberrations, cellular function, taxonomic relationships, and to gather information about past evolutionary events.

The German scientists Matthias \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Jakob_Schleiden}{Jakob Schleiden}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Virchow}{Rudolf Virchow} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Bütschli}{Otto Bütschli} were among the first scientists who recognized the structures now familiar as chromosomes. Chromosomes were first observed in plant cells by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Nägeli}{Carl Wilhelm von Nägeli} in 1842. Their behavior in animal (salamander) cells was described by Walther Flemming, the discoverer of mitosis, in 1882.

The next stage took place after the development of genetics in the early 20th century, when it was appreciated that chromosomes (that can be observed by karyotype) were the carrier of genes.

In his famous textbook The Cell in Development and Heredity, Wilson linked together the independent work of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Boveri}{Theodor Boveri} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Sutton}{Walter Sutton} (both around 1902) by naming the chromosome theory of inheritance the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boveri–Sutton_chromosome_theory}{Boveri--Sutton chromosome theory} (the names are sometimes reversed).

Investigation into the human karyotype took many years to settle the most basic question: how many chromosomes does a normal diploid human cell contain? In 1912, Hans von Winiwarter reported 47 chromosomes in spermatogonia and 48 in oogonia, concluding an XX/XO sex determination mechanism. The number of human chromosomes was published in 1923 by Theophilus Painter. By inspection through the microscope, he counted 24 pairs, which would mean 48 chromosomes. His error was copied by others and it was not until 1956 that the true number, 46, was determined by Indonesia-born cytogeneticist \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Hin_Tjio}{Joe Hin Tjio}. He was responsible for finding a new approach that settled the issue:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Using cells in tissue culture
\item
  Pretreating cells in a hypotonic solution, which swells them and spreads the chromosomes
\item
  Arresting mitosis in metaphase by a solution of colchicine
\item
  Squashing the preparation on the slide forcing the chromosomes into a single plane
\item
  Cutting up a photomicrograph and arranging the result into an indisputable karyogram.
\end{itemize}

The work took place in 1955, and was published in 1956. The karyotype of humans includes only 46 chromosomes. Rather interestingly, the great apes have 48 chromosomes. Human chromosome 2 is now known to be a result of an end-to-end fusion of two ancestral ape chromosomes.

\hypertarget{observations-on-karyotypes}{%
\section{Observations on karyotypes}\label{observations-on-karyotypes}}

\hypertarget{staining}{%
\subsection{Staining}\label{staining}}

The study of karyotypes is made possible by staining. Usually, a suitable dye, such as Giemsa, is applied after cells have been arrested during cell division by a solution of colchicine usually in metaphase or prometaphase when most condensed. In order for the Giemsa stain to adhere correctly, all chromosomal proteins must be digested and removed. For humans, white blood cells are used most frequently because they are easily induced to divide and grow in tissue culture. Sometimes observations may be made on non-dividing (interphase) cells. The sex of an unborn fetus can be determined by observation of interphase cells (see amniotic centesis and Barr body).

\hypertarget{observations}{%
\subsection{Observations}\label{observations}}

Six different characteristics of karyotypes are usually observed and compared:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Differences in absolute sizes of chromosomes. Chromosomes can vary in absolute size by as much as twenty-fold between genera of the same family. For example, the legumes \emph{Lotus tenuis} and \emph{Vicia faba} each have six pairs of chromosomes, yet \emph{V. faba} chromosomes are many times larger. These differences probably reflect different amounts of DNA duplication.
\item
  Differences in the position of centromeres. These differences probably came about through translocations.
\item
  Differences in relative size of chromosomes. These differences probably arose from segmental interchange of unequal lengths.
\item
  Differences in basic number of chromosomes. These differences could have resulted from successive unequal translocations which removed all the essential genetic material from a chromosome, permitting its loss without penalty to the organism (the dislocation hypothesis) or through fusion. Humans have one pair fewer chromosomes than the great apes. Human chromosome 2 appears to have resulted from the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes, and many of the genes of those two original chromosomes have been translocated to other chromosomes.
\item
  Differences in number and position of satellites. Satellites are small bodies attached to a chromosome by a thin thread.
\item
  Differences in degree and distribution of heterochromatic regions. Heterochromatin stains darker than euchromatin. Heterochromatin is packed tighter. Heterochromatin consists mainly of genetically inactive and repetitive DNA sequences as well as containing a larger amount of Adenine-Thymine pairs. Euchromatin is usually under active transcription and stains much lighter as it has less affinity for the giemsa stain. Euchromatin regions contain larger amounts of Guanine-Cytosine pairs. The staining technique using giemsa staining is called G banding and therefore produces the typical ``G-Bands''.
\end{enumerate}

A full account of a karyotype may therefore include the number, type, shape and banding of the chromosomes, as well as other cytogenetic information.

Variation is often found:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  between the sexes,
\item
  between the germ-line and soma (between gametes and the rest of the body),
\item
  between members of a population (chromosome polymorphism),
  in geographic specialization, and
  in mosaics or otherwise abnormal individuals.
  Human karyotype.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{human-karyotype}{%
\section{Human karyotype}\label{human-karyotype}}

The normal human karyotypes contain 22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes (allosomes; Figure \ref{fig:karyo}). Normal karyotypes for females contain two X chromosomes and are denoted 46,XX; males have both an X and a Y chromosome denoted 46,XY. Any variation from the standard karyotype may lead to developmental abnormalities.

\hypertarget{ploidy}{%

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy}{Ploidy} is the number of complete sets of chromosomes in a cell.

\hypertarget{aneuploidy}{%
\subsection{Aneuploidy}\label{aneuploidy}}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneuploidy}{Aneuploidy} is the condition in which the chromosome number in the cells is not the typical number for the species. This would give rise to a chromosome abnormality such as an extra chromosome or one or more chromosomes lost. Abnormalities in chromosome number usually cause a defect in development. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome}{Down syndrome} (Figure \ref{fig:Down}) and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_syndrome}{Turner syndrome} are examples of this.

\hypertarget{chromosome-abnormalities}{%
\section{Chromosome abnormalities}\label{chromosome-abnormalities}}

Chromosome abnormalities can be numerical, as in the presence of extra or missing chromosomes, or structural, as in derivative chromosome, translocations, inversions, large-scale deletions or duplications. Numerical abnormalities, also known as aneuploidy, often occur as a result of nondisjunction during meiosis in the formation of a gamete; trisomies, in which three copies of a chromosome are present instead of the usual two, are common numerical abnormalities. Structural abnormalities often arise from errors in homologous recombination. Both types of abnormalities can occur in gametes and therefore will be present in all cells of an affected person's body, or they can occur during mitosis and give rise to a genetic mosaic individual who has some normal and some abnormal cells.

\hypertarget{chromosome-banding}{%
\section{Chromosome banding}\label{chromosome-banding}}

Chromosomes display a banded pattern when treated with some stains. Bands are alternating light and dark stripes that appear along the lengths of chromosomes. Unique banding patterns are used to identify chromosomes and to diagnose chromosomal aberrations, including chromosome breakage, loss, duplication, translocation or inverted segments. A range of different chromosome treatments produce a range of banding patterns: G-bands, R-bands, C-bands, Q-bands, T-bands and NOR-bands.

Cytogenetics employs several techniques to visualize different aspects of chromosomes.

\hypertarget{types-of-banding}{%
\subsection{Types of banding}\label{types-of-banding}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  G-banding is obtained with Giemsa stain following digestion of chromosomes with trypsin. It yields a series of lightly and darkly stained bands --- the dark regions tend to be heterochromatic, late-replicating and AT rich. The light regions tend to be euchromatic, early-replicating and GC rich. This method will normally produce 300--400 bands in a normal, human genome.
\item
  R-banding is the reverse of G-banding (the R stands for ``reverse''). The dark regions are euchromatic (guanine-cytosine rich regions) and the bright regions are heterochromatic (thymine-adenine rich regions).
\item
  C-banding: Giemsa binds to constitutive heterochromatin, so it stains centromeres.The name is derived from centromeric or constitutive heterochromatin. The preparations undergo alkaline denaturation prior to staining leading to an almost complete depurination of the DNA. After washing the probe the remaining DNA is renatured again and stained with Giemsa solution consisting of methylene azure, methylene violet, methylene blue, and eosin. Heterochromatin binds a lot of the dye, while the rest of the chromosomes absorb only little of it. The C-bonding proved to be especially well-suited for the characterization of plant chromosomes.
\item
  Q-banding is a fluorescent pattern obtained using quinacrine for staining. The pattern of bands is very similar to that seen in G-banding.They can be recognized by a yellow fluorescence of differing intensity. Most part of the stained DNA is heterochromatin. Quinacrin (atebrin) binds both regions rich in AT and in GC, but only the AT-quinacrin-complex fluoresces. Since regions rich in AT are more common in heterochromatin than in euchromatin, these regions are labelled preferentially. The different intensities of the single bands mirror the different contents of AT. Other fluorochromes like DAPI or Hoechst 33258 lead also to characteristic, reproducible patterns. Each of them produces its specific pattern. In other words: the properties of the bonds and the specificity of the fluorochromes are not exclusively based on their affinity to regions rich in AT. Rather, the distribution of AT and the association of AT with other molecules like histones, for example, influences the binding properties of the fluorochromes.
\item
  T-banding: visualize telomeres.
  Silver staining: Silver nitrate stains the nucleolar organization region-associated protein. This yields a dark region where the silver is deposited, denoting the activity of rRNA genes within the NOR.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{classic-karyotype-cytogenetics}{%
\subsection{Classic karyotype cytogenetics}\label{classic-karyotype-cytogenetics}}

In the ``classic'' (depicted) karyotype, a dye, often Giemsa (G-banding), less frequently mepacrine (quinacrine), is used to stain bands on the chromosomes (Figure \ref{fig:karyo}). Giemsa is specific for the phosphate groups of DNA. Quinacrine binds to the adenine-thymine-rich regions. Each chromosome has a characteristic banding pattern that helps to identify them; both chromosomes in a pair will have the same banding pattern.

Karyotypes are arranged with the short arm of the chromosome on top, and the long arm on the bottom. Some karyotypes call the short and long arms p and q, respectively. In addition, the differently stained regions and sub-regions are given numerical designations from proximal to distal on the chromosome arms. For example, Cri du chat syndrome involves a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5. It is written as 46,XX,5p-. The critical region for this syndrome is deletion of p15.2 (the locus on the chromosome), which is written as 46,XX,del(5)(p15.2).

\subsection{Multicolor FISH (mFISH) and spectral karyotype (SKY technique)}\label{multicolor-fish-mfish-and-spectral-karyotype-sky-technique}}

Multicolor FISH and the older spectral karyotyping are molecular cytogenetic techniques used to simultaneously visualize all the pairs of chromosomes in an organism in different colors (Figure \ref{fig:sky}). Fluorescently labeled probes for each chromosome are made by labeling chromosome-specific DNA with different fluorophores. Because there are a limited number of spectrally distinct fluorophores, a combinatorial labeling method is used to generate many different colors. Fluorophore combinations are captured and analyzed by a fluorescence microscope using up to 7 narrow-banded fluorescence filters or, in the case of spectral karyotyping, by using an interferometer attached to a fluorescence microscope. In the case of an mFISH image, every combination of fluorochromes from the resulting original images is replaced by a pseudo color in a dedicated image analysis software. Thus, chromosomes or chromosome sections can be visualized and identified, allowing for the analysis of chromosomal rearrangements. In the case of spectral karyotyping, image processing software assigns a pseudo color to each spectrally different combination, allowing the visualization of the individually colored chromosomes. Multicolor FISH is used to identify structural chromosome aberrations in cancer cells and other disease conditions when Giemsa banding or other techniques are not accurate enough.

The principles of Mendelian inheritance were named for and first derived by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel}{Gregor Johann Mendel}, a nineteenth-century monk who formulated his ideas after conducting hybridization experiments with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pea}{pea plants} (\emph{Pisum sativum}) he had planted in the garden of his monastery in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravia}{Moravia}. Between 1856 and 1863, Mendel cultivated and tested some 5,000 pea plants. From these experiments, he induced two generalizations which later became known as Mendel's Principles of Heredity or Mendelian inheritance (Table \ref{tab:mendel}). He described these principles in a two-part paper, Versuche über Pflanzen-Hybriden (Experiments on Plant Hybridization), that he read to the Natural History Society of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno}{Brno} on 8 February and 8 March 1865, and which was published in 1866. Mendel's conclusions were largely ignored by the vast majority of scientists at the time. In 1900, however, his work was ``re-discovered'' by three European scientists, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_de_Vries}{Hugo de Vries}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Correns}{Carl Correns}, and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_von_Tschermak}{Erich von Tschermak}.

\section{Mendelian Genetics: A Practical Example}\label{mendelian-genetics-a-practical-example}}

In this set of experiments, we will use maize \emph{Zea mays} subsp. mays, from Spanish: maíz after Taíno mahiz), also known as corn to study \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance}{Mendelian inheritance}. This cereal grain was first domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The leafy stalk of the plant produces separate pollen and ovuliferous inflorescences or ears, which are fruits, yielding kernels or seeds. Maize has become a staple food in many parts of the world, with total production surpassing that of wheat or rice. However, not all of this maize is consumed directly by humans. Some of the maize production is used for corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and corn syrup. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn.

\hypertarget{monohybrid-cross-experiment-1}{%
\section{Monohybrid Cross (Experiment 1)}\label{monohybrid-cross-experiment-1}}

A \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monohybrid_cross}{monohybrid cross} is a mating between two individuals with different variations at one genetic trait of interest. For example, the gene for seed color in corn exists in two forms, one for purple and the other for yellow. These alternative ``forms'' are called alleles. For each biological trait, an organism inherits two alleles, one from each parent. These alleles may be the same or different. An organism that has two identical alleles for a gene is said to be homozygous for that gene (and is called a homozygote). An organism that has two different alleles for a gene is said be heterozygous for that gene (and is called a heterozygote).

The genotype of an individual is made up of the many alleles it possesses. An individual's physical appearance, or phenotype, is determined by its alleles as well as by its environment. The presence of an allele does not mean that the trait will be expressed in the individual that possesses it. If the two alleles of an inherited pair differ (the heterozygous condition), then one determines the organism's appearance and is called the dominant allele; the other has no noticeable effect on the organism's appearance and is called the recessive allele. Thus, in the example above the dominant purple kernel allele (designated R) will hide the phenotypic effects of the recessive yellow kernel allele (designated r). This is known as the Law of Dominance but it is not a transmission law: it concerns the expression of the genotype. Upper case letters are used to represent dominant alleles whereas lowercase letters are used to represent recessive alleles.

The character(s) being studied in a monohybrid cross are governed by two or multiple alleles of a single gene. A cross between two parents possessing a pair of different alleles is known as monohybrid cross. To carry out such a cross, each parent is chosen to be homozygous or true breeding for a given trait (allele). When a cross satisfies the conditions for a monohybrid cross, it is usually detected by a characteristic distribution of second-generation (F2) offspring that is sometimes called the monohybrid ratio.

Generally, the monohybrid cross is used to determine the dominance relationship between two alleles. The cross begins with the parental (P) generation. One parent is homozygous for one allele, and the other parent is homozygous for the other allele. The offspring make up the first filial (F1) generation. Every member of the F1 generation is heterozygous and the phenotype of the F1 generation expresses the dominant trait. Crossing two members of the F1 generation produces the second filial (F2) generation. Probability theory predicts that three quarters of the F2 generation will have the dominant allele's phenotype. And the remaining quarter of the F2s will have the recessive allele's phenotype. This predicted 3:1 phenotypic ratio assumes Mendelian inheritance.

In the first experiment, we will study the result obtained from a monohybrid cross. A strain of corn producing pure purple kernels (RR) is crossed with a strain producing pure yellow kernels (rr). Purple is dominant with the resulting F1 ears all bearing purple kernels. These plants that are heterozygous for a single trait are called monohybrids. When the F1 is self-pollinated, the resulting F2 ears bear both purple and yellow kernels (Figure \ref{fig:monohybrid}).

\hypertarget{punnett-square}{%
\section{Punnett Square}\label{punnett-square}}

The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punnett_square}{Punnett square} (Figures \ref{fig:punnett} and \ref{fig:punnettF1}) is a visual representation of Mendelian inheritance and used to predict an outcome of a particular cross or breeding experiment. It is named after \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Punnett}{Reginald C. Punnett}, who devised the approach. In our first experiment, both parents are homozygous, one carrying two copies of the dominant allele (R), the other two copies of the recessive (r) allele. Each parent can only make gametes that have either the R (purple) or r (yellow) allele. The Punnett square for the parental cross is shown in Figure \ref{fig:punnett}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{./figures/mendel/Punnett} 

}

\caption{Punnett square for homozygous cross.}\label{fig:punnett}
\end{figure}

The squares containing the single letters represent the possible gametes. The squares with two letters represent the zygotes resulting from the combination of the respective gametes. It can be easily seen that all offspring will be heterozygous (Rr) and therefore purple. The Punnett square for the F1 cross is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:punnettF1}

\section{Dihybrid Cross (Experiment 2)}\label{dihybrid-cross-experiment-2}}

In the second experiment, we will study the result obtained from a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihybrid_cross}{dihybrid cross}. A dihybrid cross is a cross between two different lines (varieties, strains) that differ in two observed traits. In the name ``Dihybrid cross'', the ``di'' indicates that there are two traits involved (in our example designated R and Su), the ``hybrid'' means that each trait has two different alleles (in our example R and r, or Su and su), and ``cross'' means that there are two individuals who are combining or ``crossing'' their genetic information. In our example, a pure strain of corn producing purple-starchy kernels (RR SuSu) is crossed with a pure strain producing yellow-sweet (rr susu). The starchy seeds are smooth, the sweet seeds are wrinkled. The resulting F1 ears all bear purple-starchy (smooth) kernels. Plants that are heterozygous for two traits are called dihybrids. When the F1 is self-pollinated, the resulting F2 generation contains various combinations (Figure \ref{fig:dihybrid}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{./figures/mendel/Dihybrid_cross}

\caption{Dihybrid cross}\label{fig:dihybrid}
\end{figure}

The rules of meiosis, as they apply to the dihybrid, are codified in Mendel's first law and Mendel's second law, which are also called the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment, respectively (Table \ref{tab:mendel}). For genes on separate chromosomes, each allele pair showed independent segregation. If the first filial generation (F1 generation) produces four identical offspring, the second filial generation, which occurs by crossing the members of the first filial generation, shows a phenotypic (appearance) ratio of \textbf{9:3:3:1}, where:

Now that we have obtained our data, we can ask how well the Mendelian model of inheritance actually fits our data. We will use Pearson's \(\chi^2\) test as a measure of goodness of fit. The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodness_of_fit}{goodness of fit} of a statistical model describes how well it fits a set of observations. Measures of goodness of fit typically summarize the discrepancy between observed values and the values expected under the model in question. Pearson's chi-squared test is a statistical test applied to sets of categorical data (like in our case, where we simply observe if a kernel is purple or yellow) to evaluate how likely it is that any observed difference between the sets arose by chance. It tests a null hypothesis stating that the frequency distribution of certain events observed in a sample is consistent with a particular theoretical distribution. The events considered must be mutually exclusive and have total probability 1. In our case, the ``events'' correspond to observing either purple or yellow kernels. The theoretical distribution of these events is 3:1 (we expect to observe three purple kernels for every yellow one) as predicted by Mendel's laws of inheritance. Chi-squared (\(\chi^2\)) is the sum of the squared differences between the observed and expected outcome frequencies (that is, counts of observations) divided by the expectation:

\[ \chi^2=\sum\frac{(O_{i}-E_{i})^{2}}{E_{i}} \]

where:

\emph{O\textsubscript{i}} = number (frequency) of observations of type \emph{i}

\emph{E\textsubscript{i}} = expected number (frequency) of observations of type \emph{i} according to the model

In our experiment, \emph{i} is two, since we have two types of observations (purple and yellow). Let's calculate \(\chi^2\) using our data first from the monohybrid and then the dihybrid cross.

The \(\chi^2\) statistic can be used to calculate a p-value by comparing the value of the statistic to a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution}{chi-squared distribution} with \emph{k} degrees of freedom. The number of degrees of freedom is equal to the number of categories minus 1 (in our case, we have to categories and therefore \emph{k} = 1). The p-value tells us how likely it would be to make the observations that we made, assuming the null hypothesis is true. The null hypothesis in our case is that the ratio of purple to yellow kernels is in fact 3:1. A low p-value, below the chosen significance level, indicates statistical significance, i.e., sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. A significance level of 0.05 is often used as the cutoff between significant and not-significant results.

  Add both numbers. This is the total number of observations.

  Multiply the total number of observations by 0.75 (the expected fraction of purple kernels). The result is \emph{E\textsubscript{purple}}.
\item
  Multiply the total number of observations by 0.25 (the expected fraction of yellow kernels). The result is \emph{E\textsubscript{yellow}}.
\item
  Subtract \emph{E\textsubscript{purple}} from \emph{O\textsubscript{purple}}, square the result and divide by \emph{E\textsubscript{purple}}. Write down the result of the calculation.

  Add the two numbers calculated in steps 6 and 7. The sum of the two values is the \(\chi^2\) value.
\item
  Obviously, our data do not correspond 100\% to the prediction. If they did, \(\chi^2\) would be 0. The next step, then, is to see how likely it is that the difference between observation and model are simply due to chance, i.e.~due to random errors that can never be competely avoided.

\item
  State the null hypothesis (\emph{H}\textsubscript{0}). Our \emph{H}\textsubscript{0} is that kernels with purple color will be 3 times more frequent than kernels with yellow color.
\item
  Select a desired level of confidence (significance level, p-value or alpha level) for the result of the test. It is common in many scientific investigations to use p \textless{} 0.05. This essentially means that we will reject the null hypothesis (\emph{H}\textsubscript{0}), i.e.~that our observations are consistent with a 3:1 ratio, if the p-value in our experiments is less than 0.05. In other words, a p-value less than 0.05 would indicate that there is less than a 5\% (1 in 20) chance that we would have observed the numbers we did, if the Mendelian model of inheritance is in fact applicable in our case.
\item
  Determine the p-value corresponding to your \(\chi^2\) value. The blue curve shown in Figure \ref{fig:chisqdist1df} is called the probability density function of \(\chi^2\) with one degree of freedom. The light blue shaded area under the curve between \(\chi^2=0\) and \(\chi^2=3.84\) corresponds to a probability of 95\% of observing a \(\chi^2\) value in that range if \emph{H}\textsubscript{0} is true. \(\chi^2\) values greater than 3.84 indicate a less than 5\% chance of observing the values we did, if \emph{H}\textsubscript{0} is true (light red shaded area).

  Reject \emph{H}\textsubscript{0} if \(\chi^2\) is greater than 3.84.

In the remaining 8 laboratory sessions of this course, we will clone a portion of a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene from plants, insert this gene fragment into a plasmid vector, and analyze the sequences of resulting clones using bioinformatics.

Specifically, we will:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Learn and practice some essential skills for the molecular laboratory (Chapter \ref{molecular-laboratory-skills})
\item
  Identify the plant or plants to be studied, extract the gDNA, and amplify a portion of the GAPC gene using PCR (Chapter \ref{dna-extraction-and-polymerase-chain-reaction}).
\item
  Assess the results of PCR using agarose gel electrophoresis, perform exonuclease I digestion to remove the first round PCR primers, perform nested PCR (Chapter \ref{exonuclease-i-digestion-and-nested-pcr}).
\item
  Ligate (insert) the GAPC gene fragment into a plasmid vector (Chapter \ref{agarose-gel-electrophoresis-and-ligation}).
\item
  Transform bacteria with the plasmid (Chapter \ref{transformation}).
\item
  Isolate the plasmid from the bacteria and confirm the presence of the insert by restriction enzyme digestion (Chapter \ref{plasmid-purification-and-restriction-digest}).
\item
  Prepare plasmid for DNA sequencing and send to a facility for sequencing (Chapter \ref{dna-sequencing}).
\item
  Obtain the sequence of the cloned GAPC gene fragment and analyze the cloned gene using bioinformatics (Chapter \ref{dna-sequence-analysis}).
\item
  Look at the human genome and known variations that distinguish different populations and variations that have been linked to increased risk for certain diseases (Chapter \ref{the-human-genome}).
\end{enumerate}

While we will chose and provide the plants, the reagents used in the experiments will come in the form of ready made kits. In the early days of molecular biology, researchers had to prepare all required materials themselves including the laborious purification of enzymes. Today, virtually any reagent that is required can be purchased ``off-the-shelf'', prepackaged and ready to use from a great number of suppliers. One of the oldest companies specialized in supplying materials for life science research laboratories are the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio-Rad_Laboratories}{BioRad Laboratories Inc.}, which developed the curriculum for these experiments and supplies the materials under Bio-Rad Explorer\textsubscript{TM} Cloning and Sequencing Explorer Series.

As our hands-on-time in the laboratory is limited, the RCC laboratory technicians will help us by performing some behind the scenes work between the lab sessions.

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate_dehydrogenase}{Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase} (abbreviated as GAPDH or less commonly as G3PDH) (EC 1.2.1.12) is an enzyme of \textasciitilde{}37kDa that catalyzes the sixth step of glycolysis and thus serves to break down glucose for energy and carbon molecules. In addition to this long established metabolic function, GAPDH has recently been implicated in several non-metabolic processes, including transcription activation, initiation of apoptosis, ER to Golgi vesicle shuttling, and fast axonal, or axoplasmic transport.

Because the GAPDH gene is often stably and constitutively expressed at high levels in most tissues and cells, it is considered a housekeeping gene. For this reason, GAPDH is commonly used by biological researchers as a loading control for western blot and as a control for qPCR. Plants have multiple GAPDH genes; the specific ones that have been selected for cloning are the GAPC genes.

In this laboratory you will learn how to handle small amounts of liquids using pipettes. A \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipette}{pipette} is a laboratory tool commonly used in biology, chemistry, and medicine to draw up, transport and dispense a measured volume of liquid. Pipettes come in several designs for various purposes with differing levels of accuracy and precision, from single piece glass pipettes to more complex adjustable or electronic pipettes. Micropipettes are used to handle small (1 - 1000 µL) or even very small (\textless{} 1 µL) amounts of liquids. Macropipettes are used to handle larger volumes. Accurate pipetting is crucial to the success of molecular and biochemical experiments. Mistakes during pipetting may cause experiments to fail or to make them irreproducible.

Commonly, we will use two main types of pipettes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  graduated pipettes
\item
  air displacement micropipettes
\end{itemize}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduated_pipette}{Graduated pipettes} or serological pipettes are a type macropipette made of glass or plastic consisting of a long tube with a series of graduations, as on a graduated cylinder or burette, to indicate different calibrated volumes. Today we use manual (e.g.~a rubber bulb (Figure \ref{fig:bulb})) or automatic propipetters to generate negative or positive pressure to draw up and dispense the liquids.

\end{figure}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_displacement_pipette}{Air displacement micropipettes} are a type of adjustable micropipette that deliver a measured volume of liquid; depending on size, it could be between about 0.1 µL to 1000 µL (1 ml). These pipettes require disposable tips that come in contact with the fluid. Micropipettes (also referred to as pipettors) come in several standard sizes with disposable plastic tips that are labeled in different colors (Table \ref{tab:standard}).

These pipettes operate by piston-driven air displacement (Figure \ref{fig:micropipette}) . A vacuum is generated by the vertical travel of a metal or ceramic piston within an airtight sleeve. As the piston moves upward, driven by the depression of the plunger, a vacuum is created in the space left vacant by the piston. The liquid around the tip moves into this vacuum (along with the air in the tip) and can then be transported and released as necessary. These pipettes are capable of being very precise and accurate. However, since they rely on air displacement, they are subject to inaccuracies caused by the changing environment, particularly temperature and user technique. For these reasons this equipment must be carefully maintained and calibrated, and users must be trained to exercise correct and consistent technique.

All adjustable pipettes should be calibrated and checked periodically. The simplest way to accomplish this is to pipette a specific volume of a solution with a known density (remember \(density = \frac{mass\ (g)}{volume (ml)}\). The density of distilled water is 1.0 g/ml. Therefore, the accuracy of the pipette or your pipetting skills (if you use an already calibrated pipette as in these experiments) can be checked by determining the mass of a specific volume of water using an analytical balance. We will use this technique in the following two pipetting exercises.

\section{Exercise 3: using a microcentrifuge}\label{exercise-3-using-a-microcentrifuge}}

A \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_centrifuge}{laboratory centrifuge} is a piece of laboratory equipment, driven by a motor, which spins liquid samples at high speed to separate heavy materials in a substance from lighter materials in the same substance. The heavier particles will clump at the bottom and form a pellet, while the solution above the pellet is referred to as the supernatant. Centrifuge speeds are measured in RPM (revolutions per minute) or RCF (relative centrifugal force; often referred to as `g-force').

Like all other centrifuges, laboratory centrifuges work by the sedimentation principle, where the centripetal acceleration is used to separate substances of greater and lesser density.

Microcentrifuges sit on the bench top and are used to spin small (2 ml or less) liquid samples at high speeds (up to tens of thousands times g-force). Centrifugation of small samples is important for many biological applications, such as pelleting nucleic acids or proteins from solution. Generally, we also use ``microcenfuges'' to gather the typically very small volumes of liquids that we work with into the bottom of the tube.

All centrifuges must be balanced or they will be unstable and will not spin at the correct speed. To balance a centrifuge, tubes are symmetrically arranged around the center. An odd number of tubes can be balanced with empty tubes or ``balance'' tubes filled with water (always label the ALL tubes appropriately). It is a good practice to tubes always place the tubes in the centrifuge such that the hinges face outward. This way, you will know that the pellet forms directly below the hinge of the microcentrigue tube which helps when the pellet is small and difficult to see.

\section{DNA}\label{dna}}

Deoxyribonucleic acid DNA) is a thread-like chain of nucleotides carrying the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.

The two DNA strands are called polynucleotides since they are composed of simpler monomer units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases (cytosine {[}C{]}, guanine {[}G{]}, adenine {[}A{]} or thymine {[}T{]}), a sugar called deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA.

The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, pyrimidines and purines. In a DNA molecule, the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine, the purines are adenine and guanine.

DNA stores biological information. The DNA backbone is resistant to cleavage, and both strands of the double-stranded structure store the same biological information. This information is replicated as and when the two strands separate. A large part of DNA (more than 98\% for humans) is non-coding, meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences.

The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus antiparallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription. Under the genetic code, these RNA strands are translated to specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation.

Within eukaryotic cells, DNA is organized into long structures called chromosomes. During cell division these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of DNA replication, providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi and protists) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus and some of their DNA in organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. In contrast prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm. Within the eukaryotic chromosomes, chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.

DNA was first isolated by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Miescher}{Friedrich Miescher} in 1869. Its molecular structure was first identified by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watsoni}{James Watson} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crick}{Francis Crick} at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Gosling}{Raymond Gosling}, who was a post-graduate student of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin}{Rosalind Franklin}.

DNA isolation is a process of purification of DNA from sample using a combination of physical and chemical methods. Currently it is a routine procedure in molecular biology.

\section{Polymerase chain reaction}\label{polymerase-chain-reaction}}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction}{Polymerase chain reaction} (PCR) is a technique used in molecular biology to amplify a single copy or a few copies of a segment of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence. PCR was developed in 1983 by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kary_Mullis}{Kary Mullis} when he was an employee of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetus_Corporation}{Cetus Corporation}, one of the first biotech companies. He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993 for the invention of PCR. It is an easy, cheap, and reliable way to repeatedly replicate a focused segment of DNA, a concept which is applicable to numerous fields in modern biology and related sciences. PCR is probably the most widely used technique in molecular biology and has revolutionized the field.

PCR is now a common and often indispensable technique used in clinical and research laboratories for a broad variety of applications. These include DNA cloning for sequencing, gene cloning and manipulation, gene mutagenesis; construction of DNA-based phylogenies, or functional analysis of genes; diagnosis and monitoring of hereditary diseases; amplification of ancient DNA; analysis of genetic fingerprints for DNA profiling (for example, in forensic science and parentage testing); and detection of pathogens in nucleic acid tests for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. In 1993, Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Michael Smith for his work on PCR.

The vast majority of PCR methods rely on thermal cycling, which involves exposing the reactants to cycles of repeated heating and cooling, permitting different temperature-dependent reactions---specifically, DNA melting and enzyme-driven DNA replication---to quickly proceed many times in sequence. Primers (short DNA fragments) containing sequences complementary to the target region, along with a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_polymerase}{DNA polymerase} (e.g.~Taq polymerase), after which the method is named, enable selective and repeated amplification. As PCR progresses, the DNA generated is itself used as a template for replication, setting in motion a chain reaction in which the original DNA template is exponentially amplified. The simplicity of the basic principle underlying PCR means it can be extensively modified to perform a wide array of genetic manipulations. PCR is not generally considered to be a recombinant DNA method, as it does not involve cutting and pasting DNA, only amplification of existing sequences.

Almost all PCR applications employ a heat-stable DNA polymerase, such as Taq polymerase, an enzyme originally isolated from the thermophilic bacterium \emph{Thermus aquaticus}. If heat-susceptible DNA polymerase is used, it will denature every cycle at the denaturation step. Before the use of Taq polymerase, DNA polymerase had to be manually added every cycle, which was a tedious and costly process. This DNA polymerase enzymatically assembles a new DNA strand from free nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA, by using single-stranded DNA as a template and DNA oligonucleotides (the primers mentioned above) to initiate DNA synthesis.

In the first step, the two strands of the DNA double helix are physically separated at a high temperature in a process called DNA melting. In the second step, the temperature is lowered and the two DNA strands become templates for DNA polymerase to selectively amplify the target DNA. The selectivity of PCR results from the use of primers that are complementary to sequence around the DNA region targeted for amplification under specific thermal cycling conditions.

The PCR, like recombinant DNA technology, has had an enormous impact in both basic and diagnostic aspects of molecular biology because it can produce large amounts of a specific DNA fragment from small amounts of a complex template. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA}{Recombinant DNA} techniques create molecular clones by conferring on a specific sequence the ability to replicate by inserting it into a vector and introducing the vector into a host cell. PCR represents a form of ``in vitro cloning'' that can generate, as well as modify, DNA fragments of defined length and sequence in a simple automated reaction. In addition to its many applications in basic molecular biological research, PCR promises to play a critical role in the identification of medically important sequences as well as an important diagnostic one in their detection.

\section{Exonuclease I Digestion}\label{exonuclease-i-digestion}}

Exonucleases are enzymes that work by cleaving nucleotides one at a time from the end (exo) of a polynucleotide chain. A hydrolyzing reaction that breaks phosphodiester bonds at either the 3' or the 5' end occurs. Its close relative is the endonuclease, which cleaves phosphodiester bonds in the middle (endo) of a polynucleotide chain. Exonuclease I (Phosphodiesterase I) hydrolytically removes 5'-nucleotides successively from the 3'-hydroxy termini of 3'-hydroxy-terminated oligonucleotides. We use exonuclease I to digest the oligonucleotide primers from the first PCR reaction so that they will not allow for PCR amplification in the second PCR. After the initial PCR primers have been digested, exonuclease I also needs to be inactivated before it is introduced into fresh PCR reactions to prevent it digesting the nested PCR primers.

Nested polymerase chain reaction (Nested PCR) is a modification of polymerase chain reaction intended to reduce non-specific binding in products due to the amplification of unexpected primer binding sites.

Nested polymerase chain reaction involves two sets of primers, used in two successive runs of polymerase chain reaction, the second set intended to amplify a secondary target within the first run product. This allows amplification for a low number of runs in the first round, limiting non-specific products. The second nested primer set should only amplify the intended product from the first round of amplification and not non-specific product. This allows running more total cycles while minimizing non-specific products. This is useful for very rare templates or PCR with high background.

\section{Agarose gel electrophoresis}\label{agarose-gel-electrophoresis}}

Electrophoresis (from the Greek ``electrophoron'' meaning ``to bear electrons'') is the motion of dispersed particles relative to a fluid under the influence of a spatially uniform electric field.

Agarose gel electrophoresis is a method of gel electrophoresis used in biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, and clinical chemistry to separate a mixed population of macromolecules such as DNA or proteins in a matrix of agarose, one of the two main components of agar. The proteins may be separated by charge and/or size, and the DNA and RNA fragments by length. Biomolecules are separated by applying an electric field to move the charged molecules through an agarose matrix, and the biomolecules are separated by size in the agarose gel matrix.

Agarose gels are easy to cast and are particularly suitable for separating DNA of size range most often encountered in laboratories. The separated DNA is visualized using a stain, most commonly under UV light, and the DNA fragments can be extracted from the gel with relative ease. Most agarose gels used are made using 0.5--3\% agarose which is dissolved in a suitable electrophoresis buffer.

Agarose gel is easy to cast, has relatively fewer charged groups, and is particularly suitable for separating DNA of size range most often encountered in laboratories, which accounts for the popularity of its use. The separated DNA may be viewed with stain, most commonly under UV light, and the DNA fragments can be extracted from the gel with relative ease. Most agarose gels used are between 0.7--2\% dissolved in a suitable electrophoresis buffer.

In molecular biology, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligation_(molecular_biology)}{ligation} is the joining of two nucleic acid fragments through the action of an enzyme. It is an essential laboratory procedure in the molecular cloning of DNA whereby DNA fragments are joined together to create recombinant DNA molecules, such as when a foreign DNA fragment is inserted into a plasmid. The ends of DNA fragments are joined together by the formation of phosphodiester bonds between the 3'-hydroxyl of one DNA terminus with the 5'-phosphoryl of another.

\chapter{Transformation}\label{transformation}}

In molecular biology, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)}{transformation} is the genetic alteration of a cell resulting from the direct uptake and incorporation of exogenous genetic material from its surroundings through the cell membrane(s). For transformation to take place, the recipient bacteria must be in a state of competence, which might occur in nature as a time-limited response to environmental conditions such as starvation and cell density, and may also be induced in a laboratory.

Transformation is one of three processes for horizontal gene transfer, in which exogenous genetic material passes from one bacterium to another, the other two being conjugation (transfer of genetic material between two bacterial cells in direct contact) and transduction (injection of foreign DNA by a bacteriophage virus into the host bacterium). In transformation, the genetic material passes through the intervening medium, and uptake is completely dependent on the recipient bacterium.

``Transformation'' may also be used to describe the insertion of new genetic material into nonbacterial cells, including animal and plant cells; however, because ``transformation'' has a special meaning in relation to animal cells, indicating progression to a cancerous state, the process is usually called ``transfection''.
Transformation in bacteria was first demonstrated in 1928 by the British bacteriologist \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Griffith}{Frederick Griffith}. Griffith was interested in determining whether injections of heat-killed bacteria could be used to vaccinate mice against pneumonia. However, he discovered that a non-virulent strain of \emph{Streptococcus pneumonia} could be made virulent after being exposed to heat-killed virulent strains. Griffith hypothesized that some ``transforming principle'' from the heat-killed strain was responsible for making the harmless strain virulent. In 1944 this ``transforming principle'' was identified as being genetic by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Avery}{Oswald Avery}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Munro_MacLeod}{Colin MacLeod}, and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maclyn_McCarty}{Maclyn McCarty}. They isolated DNA from a virulent strain of \emph{S. pneumoniae} and using just this DNA were able to make a harmless strain virulent. They called this uptake and incorporation of DNA by bacteria ``transformation''. The results of Avery et al.'s experiments were at first skeptically received by the scientific community and it was not until the development of genetic markers and the discovery of other methods of genetic transfer (conjugation in 1947 and transduction in 1953) by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Lederberg}{Joshua Lederberg} that Avery's experiments were accepted.

\item
  Add 1.5 ml C-growth medium into a 15 ml culture tube. Label tube with your initials and warm it at 37 °C for at least 10 min.
\item
  Label 2 LB amp IPTG agar plates with your initials (on the bottom of the plate, not the lid). Also label one of the plates ``pGAP'' for the control plasmid and the other for your ligation (pJET + your plant name).
\item
  Pipet 150 µl of fresh \emph{E. coli} starter culture (inoculated one day prior) into the prewarmed C-growth medium and place in a 37 °C incubator or water bath for 20--40 min shaking at 275 rpm.
\item
  Label a 1.5 microcentrifuge tube with your initials and ``competent cells.''
\item
  Prepare transformation buffer by combining 250 µl of transformation reagent A and 250 µl of transformation reagent B into a tube labeled ``TF buffer'' and mix thoroughly with a vortex mixer. Keep on ice until use.
\item
  After bacteria have grown in C-growth medium for 20--40 min at 37 °C with shaking, transfer the entire culture to the tube labeled ``competent cells'' by decanting. Do not put the actively growing cell culture on ice at this step.
\item
  Centrifuge the bacterial culture in a microcentrifuge at top speed for 1 min. Make sure that the microcentrifuge is balanced. Immediately put the pelleted bacterial culture on ice.
\item
  Locate the pellet of bacteria at the bottom of the tube. Remove the culture supernatant, avoiding the pellet, using a 1,000 µl pipet. Keep the cells on ice.
\item
  Pipet 300 µl of ice-cold transformation buffer into the microcentrifuge tube containing the bacterial pellet. Resuspend the pellet by gently pipetting up and down in the solution above the pellet with a 1,000 µl pipet, and gradually wear away the pellet from the bottom of the tube. Make sure that the bacteria are fully resuspended, with no clumps. Avoid removing the cells from the ice bucket for more than a few seconds.
\item
  Incubate the resuspended bacteria on ice for 5 min.
\item
  Centrifuge the bacteria in a microcentrifuge for 1 min, then place back in ice bucket immediately.
\end{enumerate}

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
Ensure that the bacteria are on ice immediately prior to and immediately following centrifugation. If the centrifuge is not close to the lab bench, take the entire ice bucket to the microcentrifuge so that the bacteria are only out of the ice bucket for 1 minute. Use a refrigerated microcentrifuge, if available.

After this step, it is very important to keep the bacteria on ice as much as possible during this procedure. Transformation efficiency will be severely compromised if the cells warm up. It is very important to treat the bacteria extremely gently during this procedure --- the bacteria are very fragile and your transformation efficiency will be compromised unless you are very gentle.

It is vital that the LB amp IPTG plates are warm at this step to ensure sufficiently high transformation efficiency. This is the heat shock for the transformation. Spreading the plate until it is dry will also reduce transformation efficiency.

\section{Plasmid}\label{plasmid}}

A plasmid is a small DNA molecule within a cell that is physically separated from a chromosomal DNA and can replicate independently. They are most commonly found as small circular, double-stranded DNA molecules in bacteria; however, plasmids are sometimes present in archaea and eukaryotic organisms. In nature, plasmids often carry genes that may benefit the survival of the organism, for example antibiotic resistance. While the chromosomes are big and contain all the essential genetic information for living under normal conditions, plasmids usually are very small and contain only additional genes that may be useful to the organism under certain situations or particular conditions. Artificial plasmids are widely used as vectors in molecular cloning, serving to drive the replication of recombinant DNA sequences within host organisms. In the laboratory, plasmids may be introduced into a cell via transformation.

Plasmids are considered replicons, units of DNA capable of replicating autonomously within a suitable host. However, plasmids, like viruses, are not generally classified as life. Plasmids are transmitted from one bacterium to another (even of another species) mostly through conjugation. This host-to-host transfer of genetic material is one mechanism of horizontal gene transfer, and plasmids are considered part of the mobilome. Unlike viruses (which encase their genetic material in a protective protein coat called a capsid), plasmids are ``naked'' DNA and do not encode genes necessary to encase the genetic material for transfer to a new host. However, some classes of plasmids encode the conjugative ``sex'' pilus necessary for their own transfer. The size of the plasmid varies from 1 to over 200 kbp, and the number of identical plasmids in a single cell can range anywhere from one to thousands under some circumstances.

The relationship between microbes and plasmid DNA is neither parasitic nor mutualistic, because each implies the presence of an independent species living in a detrimental or commensal state with the host organism. Rather, plasmids provide a mechanism for horizontal gene transfer within a population of microbes and typically provide a selective advantage under a given environmental state. Plasmids may carry genes that provide resistance to naturally occurring antibiotics in a competitive environmental niche, or the proteins produced may act as toxins under similar circumstances, or allow the organism to utilize particular organic compounds that would be advantageous when nutrients are scarce.

The term plasmid was introduced in 1952 by the American molecular biologist Joshua Lederberg to refer to ``any extrachromosomal hereditary determinant.'' The term's early usage included any bacterial genetic material that exists extrachromosomally for at least part of its replication cycle, but because that description includes bacterial viruses, the notion of plasmid was refined over time to comprise genetic elements that reproduce autonomously. Later in 1968, it was decided that the term plasmid should be adopted as the term for extrachromosomal genetic element, and to distinguish it from viruses, the definition was narrowed to genetic elements that exist exclusively or predominantly outside of the chromosome and can replicate autonomously.

\chapter{DNA sequencing}\label{dna-sequencing}}

DNA sequencing is the process of determining the precise order of nucleotides within a DNA molecule. It includes any method or technology that is used to determine the order of the four bases---adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine---in a strand of DNA. The advent of rapid DNA sequencing methods has greatly accelerated biological and medical research and discovery.

Knowledge of DNA sequences has become indispensable for basic biological research, and in numerous applied fields such as medical diagnosis, biotechnology, forensic biology, virology and biological systematics. The rapid speed of sequencing attained with modern DNA sequencing technology has been instrumental in the sequencing of complete DNA sequences, or genomes of numerous types and species of life, including the human genome and other complete DNA sequences of many animal, plant, and microbial species.

The first DNA sequences were obtained in the early 1970s by academic researchers using laborious methods based on two-dimensional chromatography. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Sanger}{Frederick Sanger} published a method for ``DNA sequencing with chain-terminating inhibitors'' in 1977. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Gilbert}{Walter Gilbert} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Maxam}{Allan Maxam} at Harvard also developed sequencing methods, including one for ``DNA sequencing by chemical degradation''. The chain-termination method developed by Frederick Sanger and coworkers in 1977 soon became the method of choice, owing to its relative ease and reliability. When invented, the chain-terminator method used fewer toxic chemicals and lower amounts of radioactivity than the Maxam and Gilbert method. Because of its comparative ease, the Sanger method was soon automated and was the method used in the first generation of DNA sequencers.

Sanger sequencing is the method which prevailed from the 1980s until the mid-2000s. Over that period, great advances were made in the technique, such as fluorescent labelling, capillary electrophoresis, and general automation. Advancements in sequencing were aided by the concurrent development of recombinant DNA technology, allowing DNA samples to be isolated from sources other than viruses. Following the development of fluorescence-based sequencing methods with a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencer}{DNA sequencer}, DNA sequencing has become easier and orders of magnitude faster. Sanger sequencing and automated DNA sequencers will be used to determine the sequences of our GAPDH clones and be described in more detail in the subsequent chapter (Chapter \ref{dna-sequencing}.

The high demand for low-cost sequencing has driven the development of high-throughput (formerly ``next-generation'') sequencing technologies that parallelize the sequencing process, producing thousands or millions of sequences concurrently. High-throughput sequencing technologies are intended to lower the cost of DNA sequencing beyond what is possible with standard dye-terminator methods. In ultra-high-throughput sequencing as many as 500,000 sequencing-by-synthesis operations may be run in parallel. High-throughput sequencing applies to genome sequencing, genome resequencing, transcriptome profiling (RNA-Seq), DNA-protein interactions (ChIP-sequencing), and epigenome characterization.

In this laboratory session we will set up sequencing reactions. We will not perform the actual sequencing ourselves, however. Instead, we will mail the plates with the reactions to a sequencing facility. The facility will notify us when the sequencing data are availble for download from their web site. In the next laboratory session (Chapter \ref{dna-sequence-analysis}), we will use bioinformatics software to analyze the data.

\chapter{DNA sequence analysis}\label{dna-sequence-analysis}}

In this laboratory session, we will analyze the DNA sequence data from our cloned GAPDH genes generated by the DNA sequencing facility. We will learn how to use various offline and online bioinformatics software tools. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics}{Bioinformatics} is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines biology, computer science, mathematics and statistics to analyze and interpret biological data. Bioinformatics has been used for \emph{in silico} analyses of biological queries using mathematical and statistical techniques.

In the last laboratory session (Chapter \ref{dna-sequencing}), we set up the DNA sequencing reactions that the laboratory technicians mailed to the sequencing facility. There, DNA sequencing was performed using the chain termination method which was invented by Frederick Sanger and colleauges in the 1970s. This sequencing method is commonly referred to as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanger_sequencing}{Sanger sequencing} (Figure \ref{fig:sanger}). Frederick Sanger received a Nobel Prize for his invention.

\caption{The Sanger (chain-termination) method for DNA sequencing. (1) A primer is annealed to a sequence, (2) Reagents are added to the primer and template, including: DNA polymerase, dNTPs, and a small amount of all four dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) labeled with fluorophores. During primer elongation, the random insertion of a ddNTP instead of a dNTP terminates synthesis of the chain because DNA polymerase cannot react with the missing hydroxyl. This produces all possible lengths of chains. (3) The products are separated on a single lane capillary gel, where the resulting bands are read by a imaging system. (4) This produces several hundred thousand nucleotides a day, data which require storage and subsequent computational analysis.

\end{figure}

The chain-termination method requires a single-stranded DNA template, a DNA primer, a DNA polymerase, normal deoxynucleosidetriphosphates (dNTPs), and modified di-deoxynucleotidetriphosphates (ddNTPs). These chain-terminating nucleotides lack a 3'-OH group required for the formation of a phosphodiestee bend between two nucleotides. Therefore, the DNA polymerase ceases extension of DNA whenever a modified ddNTP is incorporated. The ddNTPs thus \textbf{terminate} the elongation of the newly copied DNA strand. Originally, the ddNTPs were radioactively labelled and four separate sequencing reactions, one for each of the four ddNTPs, had to be set up. Following several rounds of template DNA extension, the resulting DNA fragments were heat denatured and separated by size using gel electrophoresis. Each of the four sequencing reactions was loaded in separate lanes (lanes A, T, G, C). The DNA bands were then visualized by autoradiography. The DNA sequence could be read off the X-ray film by reading from the shortest (at the bottom of the gel) to the longest (at the top of the gel) fragment across the four lanes of the gel.

Since its invention, Sanger sequencing has been improved by several modifications. For example, in cycle sequencing a thermostable DNA polymerase is used. This polymerase can be heated to 95 °C and still retain activity and the sequencing reaction can be repeated multiple times in the same tube by heating the mixture to denature the DNA and then allowing it to cool to anneal the primers and polymerize new strands (similar to PCR). Thus, less DNA is needed than for conventional sequencing reactions. Moreover, today, fluorescently labeled ddNTPs are used. Each ddNTP is labelled with a different fluorescent dye (emitting light at different wavelengths; e.g.~blue, green, yellow and red). The labelled DNA fragments are separated using capillary electrophoresis. A laser is used to excite the fluorescence of the labeled ddNTPs and a video camera records the color signal which is digitized and stored on a computer as a digital chromatogram. The chromatogram is analyzed using computer software which generates a graph (also referred to a as a trace) of the intensity of each color against electrophoresis running time resulting in overlapping peaks and troughs of different color. The peaks are used to assign a corresponding sequence letter (A, T, C, G or N in case the software cannot unequivocally decide which base to call). The plotted peak intensities and associated base calls are saved in a seqeuncing data file with the extension ``.ab1''. Part of a sequencing trace with associated base calls is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:chromatogram}. A base is considered to be of high quality when its identity is unambiguous. A high-quality region of sequence has evenly spaced peaks that do only overlap at their base and has signal intensity in the proper range for the detection software. In today's laboratory session, we will analyze the data files containing the results of our sequencing project.

Now that we have inspected our DNA sequences and ascertained their quality, we will use the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Tool) program to compare it with all DNA sequences stored in Genbank. \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/}{GenBank} is the NIH genetic sequence database, an annotated collection of all publicly available DNA sequences. GenBank is part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration, which comprises the DNA DataBank of Japan (DDBJ), the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), and GenBank at NCBI. These three organizations exchange data on a daily basis.

There are several ways to search and retrieve data from GenBank:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Search GenBank for sequence identifiers and annotations with Entrez Nucleotide, which is divided into three divisions:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    CoreNucleotide (the main collection)
  \item
    dbEST (Expressed Sequence Tags)
  \item
    dbGSS (Genome Survey Sequences).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Search and align GenBank sequences to a query sequence using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool).
\end{enumerate}

We will use BLAST to search te CoreNucleotide main collection.

\chapter{The Human Genome}\label{the-human-genome}}

In this lab session, we will take a closer look at the human genome and known variations that distinguish different populations and variations that have been linked to increased risk for certain diseases.

The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome}{human genome} is the complete set of nucleic acid sequences for humans, encoded as DNA within the 23 chromosome pairs in cell nuclei and in a small DNA molecule found within mitochondria. The human genome includes both protein-coding DNA genes and noncoding DNA. The haploid human genome in egg and sperm cells consists of more than three billion DNA base pairs (Table \ref{tab:chr}), while the diploid genome in somatic cells has twice the DNA content. The Human Genome Project (HGP) produced the first (almost) complete sequence of the human genome, with the first draft sequence and initial analysis being published in 2001.

\hypertarget{the-human-genome-project}{%
\section{The Human Genome Project}\label{the-human-genome-project}}

The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project}{Human Genome Project} was an international scientific research project with the goal of determining the sequence of nucleotide base pairs that make up human DNA, and of identifying and mapping all of the genes of the human genome from both a physical and a functional standpoint. After the idea was picked up in 1984 by the US government when the planning started, the project formally launched in 1990 and was declared complete in 2003. Funding came from the US government through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as well as numerous other groups from around the world. A parallel project was conducted outside government by the Celera Corporation, or Celera Genomics, which was formally launched in 1998. Most of the government-sponsored sequencing was performed in twenty universities and research centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany, Spain and China.

The Human Genome Project originally aimed to map the nucleotides contained in a human haploid reference genome (more than three billion). The project was not able to sequence all the DNA found in human cells. It sequenced only euchromatic regions of the genome, which make up 92\% of the human genome. The other regions, called heterochromatic, are found in centromeres and telomeres, and were not sequenced under the project. An initial rough draft of the human genome was available in June 2000 and by February 2001 a working draft had been completed and published followed by the final sequencing mapping of the human genome on April 14, 2003. Although this was reported to cover 99\% of the euchromatic human genome with 99.99\% accuracy, a major quality assessment of the human genome sequence was published on May 27, 2004 indicating over 92\% of sampling exceeded 99.99\% accuracy which was within the intended goal. Further analyses and papers on the HGP continue to occur.

The most recent official version of the human genome sequence is the Dec.~2013 (GRCh38/hg38) assembly of the human genome (hg38, GRCh38 Genome Reference Consortium Human Reference 38 (GCA\_000001405.15)). The Dec.~2013 human reference sequence (GRCh38) was produced by the \href{http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/}{Genome Reference Consortium}.

An assembly is a set of chromosomes, unlocalized and unplaced (random) sequences and alternate loci used to represent an organism's genome. Most current assemblies are a haploid representation of an organism's genome, although some loci may be represented more than once. The human genome reference assembly has been obtained from multiple individuals. The haploid assembly does not represent a single haplotype, but rather a mixture of haplotypes. As sequencing technology evolves, it is anticipated that diploid sequences representing an individual's genome will become available.

A haplotype (haplo: from Ancient Greek ὰπλόος (haplos, single, simple)) is a contiguous section of closely linked segments of DNA within the larger genome that tend to be inherited together as a unit on a single chromosome. Haplotypes have no defined size and can refer to anything from a few closely linked loci up to an entire chromosome. The term is also used to describe groups of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are statistically associated.

The term `haplogroup' refers to the SNP/unique-event polymorphism (UEP) mutations that represent the clade to which a collection of particular human haplotypes belong. (Clade here refers to a set of haplotypes sharing a common ancestor.) A haplogroup is a group of similar haplotypes that share a common ancestor with a single-nucleotide polymorphism mutation. Mitochondrial DNA passes along a maternal lineage hat can date back thousands of years. Similarly, the Y-chromosome passes along the paternal lineage.

A chromosome assembly represents a relatively complete pseudo-molecule assembled from smaller sequences (components) that represent a biological chromosome. Relatively complete implies that some gaps may still be present in the assembly (e.g.~there are still gaps in the human genome assembly), but independent measures suggest that most of the sequence is represented by sequenced bases. An unlocalized sequence is a sequence found in an assembly that is associated with a specific chromosome but cannot be ordered or oriented on that chromosome. An unplaced sequence is a sequence found in an assembly that is not associated with any chromosome.

Assemblies are built from components, which in turn are joined to form contigs, which are used to build scaffolds (definitions of these and other relevant terms can be found on the \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc/help/definitions/\#ALTERNATE}{GRC web site}).

HGP scientists used white blood cells from the blood of two male and two female donors (randomly selected from 20 of each) each donor yielding a separate DNA library. One of these libraries (RP11) was used considerably more than others, due to quality considerations. More than 70\% of the reference genome produced by the public HGP came from RP11, a single anonymous male donor from Buffalo, New York (code name RP11).

The genome was broken into smaller pieces; approximately 150,000 base pairs in length. These pieces were then ligated into a type of vector known as ``bacterial artificial chromosomes'', or BACs, which are derived from bacterial chromosomes which have been genetically engineered. The vectors containing the genes can be introduced into bacteria where they are copied by the bacterial DNA replication machinery. Each of these pieces was then sequenced separately as a small ``shotgun'' project and then assembled. The larger, 150,000 base pairs go together to create chromosomes. This is known as the ``hierarchical shotgun'' approach, because the genome is first broken into relatively large chunks, which are then mapped to chromosomes before being selected for sequencing.

The ``genome'' of any given individual is unique; mapping the ``human genome'' involved sequencing a small number of individuals and then assembling these together to get a complete sequence for each chromosome. Therefore, the finished human genome is a mosaic, not representing any one individual. In fact, we now know that there is variation in the genomes of individual cells in any one human. The implications of this recent finding for human health will keep scientists busy for a long time.

\section{Public-Private Competition Around The Human Genome Project}\label{public-private-competition-around-the-human-genome-project}}

In 1998, a privately funded quest to sequence the human genome was launched by the American researcher \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Venter}{Craig Venter}, and his firm \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celera_Corporation}{Celera Genomics}. Venter was a scientist at the NIH during the early 1990s when the project was initiated. The \$300,000,000 Celera effort was intended to proceed at a faster pace and at a fraction of the cost of the roughly \$3 billion publicly funded project. The Celera approach was able to proceed at a much more rapid rate, and at a lower cost than the public project because it relied upon data made available by the publicly funded project.

Celera used a technique called whole genome shotgun sequencing, employing pairwise end sequencing, which had been used to sequence bacterial genomes of up to six million base pairs in length, but not for anything nearly as large as the three billion base pair human genome.

Celera initially announced that it would seek patent protection on ``only 200-300'' genes, but later amended this to seeking ``intellectual property protection'' on ``fully-characterized important structures'' amounting to 100-300 targets. The firm eventually filed preliminary (``place-holder'') patent applications on 6,500 whole or partial genes. Celera also promised to publish their findings in accordance with the terms of the 1996 ``Bermuda Statement'', by releasing new data annually (the HGP released its new data daily), although, unlike the publicly funded project, they would not permit free redistribution or scientific use of the data. The publicly funded competitors were compelled to release the first draft of the human genome before Celera for this reason. On July 7, 2000, the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group released a first working draft on the web. The scientific community downloaded about 500 GB of information from the UCSC genome server in the first 24 hours of free and unrestricted access.

In March 2000, US President Clinton announced that the genome sequence could not be patented, and should be made freely available to all researchers. The statement sent Celera's stock plummeting and dragged down the biotechnology-heavy Nasdaq. The biotechnology sector lost about \$50 billion in market capitalization in two days.

Although the working draft was announced in June 2000, it was not until February 2001 that Celera and the HGP scientists published details of their drafts. Special issues of Nature (which published the publicly funded project's scientific paper){[}43{]} and Science (which published Celera's paper) described the methods used to produce the draft sequence and offered analysis of the sequence. These drafts covered about 83\% of the genome (90\% of the euchromatic regions with 150,000 gaps and the order and orientation of many segments not yet established). In February 2001, at the time of the joint publications, press releases announced that the project had been completed by both groups. Improved drafts were announced in 2003 and 2005, filling in to approximately 92\% of the sequence currently.

\hypertarget{genome-annotation}{%
\section{Genome Annotation}\label{genome-annotation}}

The process of identifying the boundaries between genes and other features in a raw DNA sequence is called genome annotation and is in the domain of bioinformatics. Annotation of genes (coding sequences, CDS) is provided by multiple public resources, using different methods, and resulting in information that is similar but not always identical. The \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/CCDS/CcdsBrowse.cgi}{Consensus CDS (CCDS) project} is a collaborative effort to identify a core set of protein coding regions that are consistently annotated and of high quality and support convergence towards a standard set of gene annotations. While expert biologists make the best annotators, their work proceeds slowly, and computer programs are increasingly used to meet the high-throughput demands of genome sequencing projects. Beginning in 2008, a new technology known as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq}{RNA-seq} was introduced that allowed scientists to directly sequence the messenger RNA in cells. This replaced previous methods of annotation, which relied on inherent properties of the DNA sequence, with direct measurement, which was much more accurate. Today, annotation of the human genome and other genomes relies primarily on deep sequencing of the transcripts in every human tissue using RNA-seq. These experiments have revealed that over 90\% of genes contain at least one and usually several alternative splice variants, in which the exons are combined in different ways to produce 2 or more gene products from the same locus.

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_HapMap_Project}{The International HapMap Project} was an organization that aimed to develop a haplotype map (HapMap) of the human genome, to describe the common patterns of human genetic variation. HapMap is used to find genetic variants affecting health, disease and responses to drugs and environmental factors. The information produced by the project was made freely available for research.

Four populations were selected for inclusion in the HapMap: 30 adult-and-both-parents Yoruba trios from Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI), 30 trios of Utah residents of northern and western European ancestry (CEU), 44 unrelated Japanese individuals from Tokyo, Japan (JPT) and 45 unrelated Han Chinese individuals from Beijing, China (CHB).

All samples were collected through a community engagement process with appropriate informed consent. The community engagement process was designed to identify and attempt to respond to culturally specific concerns and give participating communities input into the informed consent and sample collection processes.

In phase III, 11 global ancestry groups were assembled: ASW (African ancestry in Southwest USA); CEU (Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry from the CEPH collection); CHB (Han Chinese in Beijing, China); CHD (Chinese in Metropolitan Denver, Colorado); GIH (Gujarati Indians in Houston, Texas); JPT (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan); LWK (Luhya in Webuye, Kenya); MEX (Mexican ancestry in Los Angeles, California); MKK (Maasai in Kinyawa, Kenya); TSI (Tuscans in Italy); YRI (Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria).

Through this research millions of SNPs were discovered and many GWAS studies used this dataset in research for disease association. This project was a stepping stone for the 1000 genomes project which utilizes many of the same populations.

The \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21088/}{Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database} (dbSNP) is a public-domain archive for a broad collection of simple genetic polymorphisms. This collection of polymorphisms includes single-base nucleotide substitutions (also known as single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), small-scale multi-base deletions or insertions (also called deletion insertion polymorphisms or DIPs), and retroposable element insertions and microsatellite repeat variations (also called short tandem repeats or STRs). Please note that in this chapter, you can substitute any class of variation for the term SNP. Each dbSNP entry includes the sequence context of the polymorphism (i.e., the surrounding sequence), the occurrence frequency of the polymorphism (by population or individual), and the experimental method(s), protocols, and conditions used to assay the variation.

The Reference SNP cluster ID (rsid) is an accession number used to refer to specific SNPs in the database.

\section{The 1000 Genomes Project}\label{the-1000-genomes-project}}

The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000_Genomes_Project}{1000 Genomes Project} launched in January 2008, is an international research effort to establish by far the most detailed catalogue of human genetic variation (Table \ref{tab:thousand}). Scientists planned to sequence the genomes of at least one thousand anonymous participants from a number of different ethnic groups within the following three years, using newly developed technologies which were faster and less expensive. In 2015, two papers in the journal Nature reported results and the completion of the project and opportunities for future research. Many rare variations, restricted to closely related groups, were identified, and eight structural-variation classes were analyzed.

The project unites multidisciplinary research teams from institutes around the world, including China, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Nigeria, Peru, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The team have been contributing to the enormous sequence dataset and to a refined human genome map, which are freely accessible through public databases to the scientific community and the general public alike. The \href{http://www.internationalgenome.org/home}{International Genome Sample Resource} (IGSR) was established at the European Bioinformatics Institute (\href{https://www.ebi.ac.uk}{EMBL-EBI}) in January 2015. The resource was established with three main \href{http://www.internationalgenome.org/sample_collection_principles}{aims}, to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Ensure maximal usefulness and relevance of the existing 1000 Genomes data resources
\item
  Extend the resource for the existing populations
\item
  Expand the resource to new populations
\end{enumerate}

By providing an overview of all human genetic variation, the consortium has generated a valuable tool for all fields of biological science, especially in the disciplines of genetics, medicine, pharmacology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics.

\section{Personal genomics}\label{personal-genomics}}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_genomics}{Personal genomics} or consumer genetics is the branch of genomics concerned with the sequencing, analysis and interpretation of the genome of an individual. The genotyping stage employs different techniques, including single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis chips (typically 0.02\% of the genome), or partial or full genome sequencing. Once the genotypes are known, the individual's variations can be compared with the published literature to determine likelihood of trait expression, ancestry inference and disease risk.

Automated high-throughput sequencers have increased the speed and reduced the cost of sequencing, making it possible to offer genetic testing to consumers for less than \$1,000. The emerging market of direct-to-consumer genome sequencing services has brought new questions about both the medical efficacy and the ethical dilemmas associated with widespread knowledge of individual genetic information. Companies like \href{https://www.ancestry.com}{Ancestry} and \href{https://www.23andme.com}{23andMe}, however, do not sequence your DNA but perform ``genotyping'' using DNA microarrays (``genotyping chips'') to determine SNPs at hundreds of thousands of locations in your genome. Ancestry, for example state that they examine some 700,000 SNPs.

Starting in 2005 as a pilot experiment with 10 individuals, the \href{https://pgp.med.harvard.edu}{Harvard Personal Genome Project} (Harvard PGP) pioneered a new form of genomics research. The main goal of the project is to allow scientists to connect human genetic information (human DNA sequence, gene expression, associated microbial sequence data, etc) with human trait information (medical information, biospecimens and physical traits) and environmental exposures.

PGP participants consent to publicly share their genomic and trait data in a free and open manner to be used for unimpeded research and other scientific, patient care and commercial purposes worldwide. Consistent with this consent, the project organizers seek to lower as many barriers as possible to access PGP data and cells to empower and engage the scientific community to drive new knowledge about human biology. The project now has over 5,000 participants.

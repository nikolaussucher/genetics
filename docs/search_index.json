["lab-safety.html", "3 Lab Safety 3.1 General rules 3.2 Class dissections 3.3 Clothing 3.4 Handling chemicals 3.5 Glassware 3.6 Heating substances 3.7 Handling microbiology materials", " 3 Lab Safety The laboratory classes are hands-on. Some classes require the use of hazardous chemicals and materials. Safety in the classroom is the #1 priority for students and faculty. To ensure a safe science laboratory, a list of rules must be followed at all times. Please watch the RCC safety video Prior to your participation in the science lab course, you must read this safety document and sign and return the acknowledgment and agreement page. 3.1 General rules NO FOOD, BEVERAGES, GUM, in the labs. Cell phone usage is also prohibited in the lab. Conduct yourself in a responsible manner at all times in the lab. Horseplay, pranks and practical jokes are prohibited and will not be tolerated. If you participate in inappropriate behavior the INSTRUCTOR HAS THE RIGHT TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE THE lab. Students cannot be in the lab without an instructor present. Read all lab procedures, precautions, and equipment instructions thoroughly before each lab. Follow all written and verbal instructions carefully. Perform only those experiments authorized by the instructor. If during the lab you don’t understand, stop and ask the instructor before proceeding. Never do anything in the lab that is outside of your instructors directions or that is not in your lab procedure. Do not begin lab activities; touch any chemicals or equipment until you are instructed to do so. Work areas should be kept organized and clean at all times. Only necessary items (lab notebook, worksheets, etc.) should be on your workbench. Backpacks and purses must be stored under the benches or against the walls. CLEAN ALL OF YOUR WORK SURFACES AND EQUIPMENT AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT. Safely dispose of waste in its proper container and place glassware in the grey bins by the sink. DO NOT STACK GLASSWARE. If the bin is full ask the instructor for another bin. Keep aisles clear. Push lab stools under the lab benches when not in use. Know where the safety equipment is and how to use it. This includes the first aid kit, eyewash station, safety shower, fire extinguisher, and fire blanket. Know the location of the fire alarm, and emergency phone. In the event of a fire drill during lab time containers must be closed, gas valves off, fume hood, and all electrical equipment must be turned off. NEVER DISPOSE OF ANYTHING IN THE SINK. All materials are to be disposed of in the proper hazardous waste containers with the assistance of the instructor. All waste containers must be closed and placed inside a secondary containment bin. As classes in these labs use toxic chemicals, keep your hands away from your face, eyes and mouth while working in the lab. Always wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap before leaving the lab to prevent injury or illness. This is part of proper lab procedure. Students are not permitted in the prep room areas (between the lab rooms). Handle all living organisms used for lab experiments in a respectful, humane manner. Microscopes must be properly cleaned, the electrical cords properly wrapped, and returned to their places with their protective covers. Disposal of all hazardous waste is ONLY to be handled by the instructor and in a manner consistent with federal, state and local hazardous waste disposal regulations. Organic solvents are never to be disposed of down the sink; receptacles will be provided as needed for their collection. All hazardous chemical substances must be placed in the appropriate type of container and labeled with chemical, name and date, sealed and placed upright in a gray plastic bin. 3.2 Class dissections Preserved biological specimens should be treated with respect and disposed of in a clear plastic bag and placed inside the hazardous waste drum located in the classroom. This container must be sealed at the end of each dissection. When using sharp objects always carry the tips pointed down and away from you. When dissecting, cut away from your body. Grasp the instrument only by the handle. Never try to catch falling sharp instruments or glassware. When you are finished dissecting, wash and dry your instruments and dissecting pan before storing them in the proper location. Do not leave any instruments in the sink. 3.3 Clothing Students must wear lab goggles when using chemicals, or using heat. NO EXCEPTIONS! Lab coats are mandatory for Anatomy and Physiology, Biology, Microbiology, Chemistry, and Biotechnology labs, except for when lecturing and working on dry lab (for example, looking at models or prepared slides) activities. Gloves should be worn when handling solutions, solids, specimens, etc. Proper dress should always be observed in the lab. Long hair must be tied back. Loose or baggy clothing (especially sleeves), dangling jewelry, hats, shorts, short skirts, bare mid riffs, high heels, sleeveless shirts, and open toed or open heeled shoes and sandals are prohibited in the lab. Failure to comply may result in expulsion from class. 3.4 Handling chemicals Always work in a well-ventilated area. Use the fume hood when working with volatile substances or poisonous vapors, or any chemical with an odor. Never smell a chemical by sniffing. Use your hand to wave the chemical towards your nose. DO NOT TASTE, TOUCH or smell anything unless instructed to do so. You should wear a lab apron and gloves at all times. Your instructor will tell you the proper gloves to wear depending on the chemical being used. CHECK EACH LABEL TWICE before removing any of its contents. Take only what is needed of each chemical. NEVER return unused chemicals to their original container; put it in the waste container. Do not use your fingers to transfer solid chemicals. Use a scoop or spatula. Use a rubber bulb, pipette, or pi-pump when transferring liquid chemicals. NEVER USE YOUR MOUTH TO PIPETTE! When transferring reagents hold the containers away from your body while working on the bench. Acids must be handled with extreme care. You will be shown the proper method for diluting strong acids. ALWAYS ADD ACID TO WATER, swirl or invert the solution and be careful of the heat produced particularly with sulfuric acid. Handle hazardous liquids over a pan to contain spills. Never handle flammable liquids anywhere near an open flame or heat source. Be careful when transporting chemicals across the lab. Hold securely and walk carefully. NEVER POUR CHEMICALS INTO SINK. Waste should be disposed of in the proper hazardous waste container provided. 3.5 Glassware Never handle broken glass with bare hands. Use a brush and a dustpan to clean up broken glass. Place uncontaminated broken glass in the white and blue broken glass receptacles. Contaminated trash goes in the biohazard bin. Fill wash bottles only with distilled water and use only as intended, e.g.; rinsing glassware, adding water to a container. Never use chipped, cracked or dirty glassware to avoid shattering. Never immerse hot glassware in cold water. It may shatter. Never place dirty glassware with the clean glassware. All dirty glassware should be placed in gray wash bins. DO NOT STACK DIRTY GLASSWARE IN BINS. 3.6 Heating substances Exercise extreme caution when using a gas burner. Be careful to keep hair, loose clothing and hands away from flames at all times. Wear safety goggles. Do not put any substances into the flame unless specifically instructed to do so. Never reach over an exposed flame. The instructor will provide a demonstration of the proper way to operate a Bunsen burner. Never leave a lighted burner or hot plate unattended. Always turn the burner or hot plate off when not in use. Do not point the open end of a test tube being heated at yourself or anyone else. Never look into a container that’s being heated. Heated metals and glass remain hot for a very long time. They should be set aside to cool and picked up with caution. Use tongs or heat protective gloves. 3.7 Handling microbiology materials Please be aware that micro labs include work with pathogenic organisms. Be alert. Conduct yourself in a responsible manner at all times. If you spill anything notify your instructor immediately. There are special procedures to be followed for spills containing microorganisms. A lab coat must be worn during lab activities. Lab coats/aprons may never leave the lab. If you must leave the lab during a class then your lab coat must be removed. Gloves must be worn at all times when working with bacteria. Gloves need to be disposed of in the biohazard waste container. All contaminated waste must be disposed of in the biohazard container. Do not overfill biohazard containers. You must spray down your lab bench with Lysol after each lab. Do not wipe with paper towels. The bench surface must remain wet for at least five minutes for the Lysol to destroy any micro organisms. Wash your hands thoroughly before and after each lab as well as before you leave the lab for any reason. Dispose of contaminated broken glass in the biohazard bin. Please wrap the broken glass in paper towels before disposal so that the broken glass doesn’t cut through the bag. Dispose of uncontaminated glass in the white and blue cardboard glass boxes. "],
["mitosis-and-meiosis.html", "4 Mitosis and Meiosis 4.1 View Prepared Slides 4.2 Preparing an Onion root tip squash 4.3 Review Questions", " 4 Mitosis and Meiosis Mitosis is the part of the cell cycle when replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei. In general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is preceded by the S stage of interphase (during which the DNA is replicated) and is often accompanied or followed by cytokinesis, which divides the cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic (M) phase of an animal cell cycle (the division of the mother cell into two daughter cells genetically identical to each other). The process of mitosis is divided into stages corresponding to the completion of one set of activities and the start of the next. These stages are prophase, pro-metaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, creating four haploid cells, each genetically distinct from the parent cell that gave rise to them. This process occurs in all sexually reproducing single-celled and multicellular eukaryotes, including animals, plants, and fungi. Errors in meiosis resulting in aneuploidy are the leading known cause of miscarriage and the most frequent genetic cause of developmental disabilities. In meiosis, DNA replication is followed by two rounds of cell division to produce four daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the original parent cell. The two meiotic divisions are known as Meiosis I and Meiosis II. Before meiosis begins, during S phase of the cell cycle, the DNA of each chromosome is replicated so that it consists of two identical sister chromatids, which remain held together through sister chromatid cohesion. This S-phase can be referred to as “premeiotic S-phase” or “meiotic S-phase”. Immediately following DNA replication, meiotic cells enter a prolonged G2-like stage known as meiotic prophase. During this time, homologous chromosomes pair with each other and undergo genetic recombination, a programmed process in which DNA is cut and then repaired, which allows them to exchange some of their genetic information. A subset of recombination events results in crossovers, which create physical links known as chiasmata (singular: chiasma, for the Greek letter Chi (X)) between the homologous chromosomes. In most organisms, these links are essential to direct each pair of homologous chromosomes to segregate away from each other during Meiosis I, resulting in two haploid cells that have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. During Meiosis II, the cohesion between sister chromatids is released and they segregate from one another, as during mitosis. In some cases, all four of the meiotic products form gametes such as sperm, spores, or pollen. In female animals, three of the four meiotic products are typically eliminated by extrusion into polar bodies, and only one cell develops to produce an ovum. Because the number of chromosomes is halved during meiosis, gametes can fuse (i.e. fertilization) to form a diploid zygote that contains two copies of each chromosome, one from each parent. Thus, alternating cycles of meiosis and fertilization enable sexual reproduction, with successive generations maintaining the same number of chromosomes. For example, diploid human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes including 1 pair of sex chromosomes (46 total), half of maternal origin and half of paternal origin. Meiosis produces haploid gametes (ova or sperm) that contain one set of 23 chromosomes. When two gametes (an egg and a sperm) fuse, the resulting zygote is once again diploid, with the mother and father each contributing 23 chromosomes. This same pattern, but not the same number of chromosomes, occurs in all organisms that utilize meiosis. 4.1 View Prepared Slides View the onion root tip and observe the different stages of mitosis (Figure 4.1).

Cut off 1mm to 2mm of the root tip and throw away the upper portion of the root. Cover the root tip with four drops of 1 N HCl and warm the slide over an alcohol burner flame for 1 minute. Do not boil. Blot off the excess HCl and cover the root tip with 0.5% aqueous toluidine blue. Again, pass the slide through the alcohol burner flame for 1 minute without boiling. Blot off the excess stain, add a drop of fresh stain, and apply a coverslip. Cover the slide with a paper towel and carefully squash the coverslip firmly with your thumb. Examine the slide for the stages of mitosis as well as interphase and cytokinesis.

["mendelian-genetics.html", "5 Mendelian Genetics 5.1 Punnett square 5.2 Monohybrid cross (Experiment 1) 5.3 Dihybrid cross (Experiment 2) 5.4 Blood Typing (Experiment 3) 5.5 Review Questions", " 5 Mendelian Genetics In this experiment, we will use maize Zea mays subsp. mays, from Spanish: maíz after Taíno mahiz), also known as corn to study Mendelian inheritance. This cereal grain was first domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The leafy stalk of the plant produces separate pollen and ovuliferous inflorescences or ears, which are fruits, yielding kernels or seeds. Maize has become a staple food in many parts of the world, with total production surpassing that of wheat or rice. However, not all of this maize is consumed directly by humans. Some of the maize production is used for corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and corn syrup. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn. The principles of Mendelian inheritance were named for and first derived by Gregor Johann Mendel, a nineteenth-century Moravian monk who formulated his ideas after conducting simple hybridisation experiments with pea plants (Pisum sativum) he had planted in the garden of his monastery. Between 1856 and 1863, Mendel cultivated and tested some 5,000 pea plants. From these experiments, he induced two generalizations which later became known as Mendel’s Principles of Heredity or Mendelian inheritance (Table 5.1). He described these principles in a two-part paper, Versuche über Pflanzen-Hybriden (Experiments on Plant Hybridization), that he read to the Natural History Society of Brno on 8 February and 8 March 1865, and which was published in 1866. Mendel’s conclusions were largely ignored by the vast majority of scientists at the time. In 1900, however, his work was “re-discovered” by three European scientists, Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns, and Erich von Tschermak. Mendel discovered that, when he crossed purebred white flower and purple flower pea plants (the parental or P generation), the result was not a blend. Rather than being a mix of the two, the offspring (known as the F1 generation) was purple-flowered. When Mendel self-fertilized the F1 generation pea plants, he obtained a purple flower to white flower ratio in the F2 generation of 3 to 1. In the first experiment, we will examine the F2 generation resulting from the F1 generation obtained from a parental generation of yellow and purple corn. He then conceived the idea of heredity units, which he called “factors”. Mendel found that there are alternative forms of factors—now called genes—that account for variations in inherited characteristics. For example, the gene for flower color in pea plants exists in two forms, one for purple and the other for white. The alternative “forms” are now called alleles. For each biological trait, an organism inherits two alleles, one from each parent. These alleles may be the same or different. An organism that has two identical alleles for a gene is said to be homozygous for that gene (and is called a homozygote). An organism that has two different alleles for a gene is said be heterozygous for that gene (and is called a heterozygote). Mendel hypothesized that allele pairs separate randomly, or segregate, from each other during the production of gametes: egg and sperm. Because allele pairs separate during gamete production, a sperm or egg carries only one allele for each inherited trait. When sperm and egg unite at fertilization, each contributes its allele, restoring the paired condition in the offspring. This is called the Law of Segregation. Mendel also found that each pair of alleles segregates independently of the other pairs of alleles during gamete formation. This is known as the Law of Independent Assortment. In the second experiment, we will observe this law exemplified by a dihybrid cross of corn. The genotype of an individual is made up of the many alleles it possesses. An individual’s physical appearance, or phenotype, is determined by its alleles as well as by its environment. The presence of an allele does not mean that the trait will be expressed in the individual that possesses it. If the two alleles of an inherited pair differ (the heterozygous condition), then one determines the organism’s appearance and is called the dominant allele; the other has no noticeable effect on the organism’s appearance and is called the recessive allele. Thus, in the example above the dominant purple flower allele will hide the phenotypic effects of the recessive white flower allele. This is known as the Law of Dominance but it is not a transmission law: it concerns the expression of the genotype. The upper case letters are used to represent dominant alleles whereas the lowercase letters are used to represent recessive alleles. Table 5.1: Mendel’s laws of inheritance. Law Definition Law of segregation During gamete formation, the alleles for each gene segregate from each other so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene. Law of independent assortment Genes for different traits can segregate independently during the formation of gametes. Law of dominance Some alleles are dominant while others are recessive; an organism with at least one dominant allele will display the effect of the dominant allele. 5.1 Punnett square The Punnett square (Figures 5.1 and 5.2) is a visual representation of Mendelian inheritance and used to predict an outcome of a particular cross or breeding experiment. It is named after Reginald C. Punnett, who devised the approach. In our first experiment, both parents are homozygous, one carrying two copies of the dominant allele (R), the other two copies of the recessive (r) allele. Each parent can only make gametes that have either the R (purple) or r (yellow) allele. The Punnett square for the parental cross is shown in Figure 5.1 Figure 5.1: Punnett square for homozygous cross. The squares containing the single letters represent the possible gametes. The squares with two letters represent the zygotes resulting from the combination of the respective gametes. It can be easily seen that all offspring will be heterozygous (Rr) and therefore purple. The Punnett square for the F1 cross is depicted in Figure 5.2 Figure 5.2: Punnett square for heterozygous cross. 5.2 Monohybrid cross (Experiment 1) A monohybrid cross is a mating between two individuals with different variations at one genetic trait of interest. The character(s) being studied in a monohybrid cross are governed by two or multiple variations for a single locus. A cross between two parents possessing a pair of contrasting characters is known as monohybrid cross. To carry out such a cross, each parent is chosen to be homozygous or true breeding for a given trait (locus). When a cross satisfies the conditions for a monohybrid cross, it is usually detected by a characteristic distribution of second-generation (F2) offspring that is sometimes called the monohybrid ratio. Generally, the monohybrid cross is used to determine the dominance relationship between two alleles. The cross begins with the parental (P) generation. One parent is homozygous for one allele, and the other parent is homozygous for the other allele. The offspring make up the first filial (F1) generation. Every member of the F1 generation is heterozygous and the phenotype of the F1 generation expresses the dominant trait. Crossing two members of the F1 generation produces the second filial (F2) generation. Probability theory predicts that three quarters of the F2 generation will have the dominant allele’s phenotype. And the remaining quarter of the F2s will have the recessive allele’s phenotype. This predicted 3:1 phenotypic ratio assumes Mendelian inheritance. In the first experiment, we will study the result obtained from a monohybrid cross. A strain of corn producing pure purple kernels (RR) is crossed with a strain producing pure yellow kernels (rr). Purple is dominant with the resulting F1 ears all bearing purple kernels. These plants that are heterozygous for a single trait are called monohybrids. When the F1 is self-pollinated, the resulting F2 ears bear both purple and yellow kernels (Figure 5.3). Figure 5.3: Monohybrid cross 5.2.1 Experimental procedures Count the number of purple and yellow kernels on one row of the F2 ear without removing the kernels. Determine the ratio of purple to yellow. Now tabulate the numbers obtained by each of your class mates in Table 5.2 and add these figures to get a total. Using the total numbers, determine a ratio of purple to yellow. Table 5.2: Monohybrid cross. Row # purple yellow ratio 1 2 3 … 7 8 9 Total 5.3 Dihybrid cross (Experiment 2) In the second experiment, we will study the result obtained from a dihybrid cross. A dihybrid cross is a cross between two different lines (varieties, strains) that differ in two observed traits. In the name “Dihybrid cross”, the “di” indicates that there are two traits involved (in our example designated R and Su), the “hybrid” means that each trait has two different alleles (in our example R and r, or Su and su), and “cross” means that there are two individuals who are combining or “crossing” their genetic information. In our example, a pure strain of corn producing purple-starchy kernels (RR SuSu) is crossed with a pure strain producing yellow-sweet (rr susu). The starchy seeds are smooth, the sweet seeds are wrinkled. The resulting F1 ears all bear purple-starchy (smooth) kernels. Plants that are heterozygous for two traits are called dihybrids. When the F1 is self-pollinated, the resulting F2 generation contains various combinations (Figure 5.4). Figure 5.4: Dihybrid cross The rules of meiosis, as they apply to the dihybrid, are codified in Mendel’s first law and Mendel’s second law, which are also called the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment, respectively (Table 5.1). For genes on separate chromosomes, each allele pair showed independent segregation. If the first filial generation (F1 generation) produces four identical offspring, the second filial generation, which occurs by crossing the members of the first filial generation, shows a phenotypic (appearance) ratio of 9:3:3:1, where: the 9 represents the proportion of individuals displaying both dominant traits the first 3 represents the individuals displaying the first dominant trait and the second recessive trait the second 3 represents those displaying the first recessive trait and second dominant trait the 1 represents the homozygous, displaying both recessive traits. 5.3.1 Experimental procedures Carefully count the number of kernels of each phenotype appearing on a row of F2 ear. Tabulate the results and determine the totals and total ratios in Table 5.3. Table 5.3: Dihybrid cross. Row # purple and starchy (smooth) purple and sweet (wrinkled) yellow and starchy (smooth) yellow and sweet (wrinkled) ratio 1 2 3 … 7 8 9 Total 5.4 Blood Typing (Experiment 3) In this experiment, we will determine the ABO properties of four (artificial) blood samples. Figure 5.5: Blood type (or blood group) is determined, in part, by the ABO blood group antigens present on red blood cells. A blood type (also called a blood group) (Figure 5.5) is a classification of blood based on the presence and absence of antibodies and also based on the presence or absence of inherited antigenic substances on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs). These antigens may be proteins, carbohydrates, glycoproteins, or glycolipids, depending on the blood group system. Some of these antigens are also present on the surface of other types of cells of various tissues. Blood types are inherited and represent contributions from both parents. A total of 35 human blood group systems are now recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT). The two most important ones are ABO and the RhD (“Rhesus”) antigen; they determine someone’s blood type (A, B, AB and O, with +, - or Null denoting RhD status). 5.4.1 Experimental procedures Using the dropper vial, place a drop of the first synthetic blood sample in each well of the blood-typing slide (Figure 5.6). Replace the cap on the dropper vial. Always replace the cap on one vial before opening the next vial, to prevent cross-contamination. Add a drop of synthetic anti-A (blue) to the well labeled A. Replace the cap. Add a drop of synthetic anti-B serum (yellow) to the well labeled B. Replace the cap. Add a drop of synthetic anti-D (Rh) serum (clear) to the well labeled Rh. Replace the cap. Using a mixing stick of a different color for each well (blue for anti-A, yellow for anti-B, white for anti-Rh), gently stir the synthetic blood and anti-serum drops for 30 seconds. Remember to discard each mixing stick after a single use to avoid contamination of your samples. Carefully examine the thin films of liquid mixture left behind: If a film remains uniform in appearance, there is no agglutination. If the sample appears granular, agglutination has occurred. Answer yes or no as to whether agglutination occurred in each sample. A positive agglutination reaction indicates the blood type. Record the results for the first blood sample in Table 5.4. Determine the blood type of the sample using the results that you entered in Table 5.4. Thoroughly rinse the blood-typing slide and repeat steps 1 through 7 for synthetic blood samples 2, 3, and 4, recording the results of each test as you go (and rinsing the slide after each sample).

A pipette is a laboratory tool commonly used in biology, chemistry, and medicine to draw up, transport and dispense a measured volume of liquid. Pipettes come in several designs for various purposes with differing levels of accuracy and precision, from single piece glass pipettes to more complex adjustable or electronic pipettes. Micropipettes are used to handle small (1 - 1000 µL) or even very small (&lt; 1 µL) amounts of liquids. Macropipettes are used to handle larger volumes. Accurate pipetting is crucial to the success of molecular and biochemical experiments. Mistakes during pipetting may cause experiments to fail or to make them irreproducible. Commonly, we will use two main types of pipettes: graduated pipettes air displacement micropipettes Graduated pipettes or serological pipettes are a type macropipette made of glass or plastic consisting of a long tube with a series of graduations, as on a graduated cylinder or burette, to indicate different calibrated volumes. Today we use manual (e.g. a rubber bulb (Figure 6.1)) or automatic propipetters to generate negative or positive pressure to draw up and dispense the liquids. Figure 6.1: A rubber bulb propipetter. Air displacement micropipettes are a type of adjustable micropipette that deliver a measured volume of liquid; depending on size, it could be between about 0.1 µL to 1000 µL (1 mL). These pipettes require disposable tips that come in contact with the fluid. Micropipettes (also referred to as pipettors) come in several standard sizes with disposable plastic tips that are labeled in different colors (Table 6.1). Table 6.1: Standard micropipette volumes and colors. Name Min. volume (µL) Max. volume (µL) Color tip size (µL) P2 0.2 2 white 10 P10 1 10 white 10 P20 2 20 yellow 200 P100 20 100 yellow 200 P200 50 200 yellow 200 P1000 200 1000 blue 1000 P5000 1000 5000 green 5000 P10000 1000 10000 red 10000 These pipettes operate by piston-driven air displacement (Figure 6.2) . A vacuum is generated by the vertical travel of a metal or ceramic piston within an airtight sleeve. As the piston moves upward, driven by the depression of the plunger, a vacuum is created in the space left vacant by the piston. The liquid around the tip moves into this vacuum (along with the air in the tip) and can then be transported and released as necessary. These pipettes are capable of being very precise and accurate. However, since they rely on air displacement, they are subject to inaccuracies caused by the changing environment, particularly temperature and user technique. For these reasons this equipment must be carefully maintained and calibrated, and users must be trained to exercise correct and consistent technique. Figure 6.2: Schematic of an air displacement pipette. The “Digital volume indicator” is a dial display that indicates the digits (i.e. unrelated to electronic). The components vary between brands and different volume sizes have different components, for example the piston in a P2 is needle-like and can be separated with ease from the piston assembly whereas in a P10mL it is drum-like and over 1 cm in diameter and is enclosed in plastic.

All adjustable pipettes should be calibrated and checked periodically. The simplest way to accomplish this is to pipette a specific volume of a solution with a known density (remember density = mass (g) ÷ volume (mL)). The density of distilled water is 1.0 g/mL. Therefore, the accuracy of the pipette or your pipetting skills (if you use an already calibrated pipette as in these experiments) can be checked by determining the mass of a specific volume of water using an analytical balance. We will use this technique in the follwoing two pipetting exercises. 6.1 Exercise 1: using graduated (serological) macropipettes 6.1.1 Experimental procedures Obtain a graduated pipette. Notice that the tapered delivery tip at one end of the pipette. Always hold the pipette upright. Attach the rubber bulb or mechanical pipetter to the other (blunt) end of the pipette. Dip the pipette into the solution without touching the bottom of the vessel containg the liquid you want to draw up. Draw up the liquid until the meniscus reaches the position on the scale printed on the pipette corresponding to the desired volume. Dispense the liquid into a weigh boat. Determine the mass of the dispensed volume and record your result in Table 6.2. Empty the weigh boat, put it on the balance and set the balance to zero. Calculate the average for each triplicate set, and the percentage error (relative to the average value) for each measurement and enter your results in Table 6.3. Error (%) = (expected mass − experimentally determined mass) ÷ expected mass × 100% Your results should be witin ±5% of the correct volume set on the dial of the pipette. Table 6.2: Experimental determination of graduated pipette volumes.

Obtain a micropipette. Identify the main parts of the micropipette (Figure 6.2) Plunger button Tip ejector button Volume adjustment dial Digital volume indicator Shaft Attachment point for a disposable tip Set the pipetting volume. Do not adjust the volume beyond the maximum setting! This will damage the pipettor. Attach a tip to the pipette. Hold the pipette vertically and press the plunger button to the first stop. Dip the tip into the sample and slowly release it, moving the plunger button to the home position. Press the plunger button all the way to the second stop to dispense the sample. Now, carefully draw up and dispense the volumes of distilled water listed in Table 6.3 with the indicated micropipette into the weigh boat. Always keep an eye on the tip and watch the sample: note when it enters the tip and enters the final location. Do not assume some “got in”, especially with small volumes and clear solutions. Remember the approximate levels that particular volumes fill the tip – this will allow you to check your pipetting visually. Record the value of the mass of the dispensed water. Set the balance back to zero. Repeat twice. Eject the tip. Calculate the average for each triplicate set, and the percentage error (relative to the average value) for each measurement and enter your results in Table 6.3. Error (%) = (expected mass − experimentally determined mass) ÷ expected mass × 100% Your results should be witin ±5% of the correct volume set on the dial of the pipette.

Do not touch the tube with the pipette, only with the tip. Large volume: Add 165 µL to a tube Add 435 µL to the same tube Remove 615 µL from the tube Remove 32 µL from the tube Small volume: Add 5.3 µL to a tube Add 15.5 µL to the same tube Remove 12.6 µL from the tube Remove 7.2 µL from the tube Very small volume: Add 1.3 µL Add 2.8 µL Remove 4.2 µL Remove 0.7 µL Hold the pipette almost vertically in the plam of your right hand (if you are right handed). Depress plunger to first stop and hold. Dip tip 2-4 mm into the beaker with distilled water. Gently release the plunger. If you release too quickly, you will create aerosols (small droplets) which will contaminate the pipette. Wait for a second or so and confirm that all the liquid has been taken up. Touch the pipette tip to the inside wall of the beaker to dislodge any remaining droplets adhering to the outside of the tip. Check that there is no air space at the very end of the tip. Put the tube containing the sample in the tube rack and pick up the tube that you want to add the sample to. Hold the tube between your thumb and index finger of your left hand. To expel sample into the tube, touch the tip to wall of the tube and slowly depress the plunger to the first, and then to the second stop to expel the liquid. Keeping the plunger at the second stop, slide the tip out of the fluid, along the tube wall and out of the tube. Look for the small droplet of liquid in the tube to make sure that it was transferred. 6.3 Exercise 3: using a microcentrifuge A laboratory centrifuge is a piece of laboratory equipment, driven by a motor, which spins liquid samples at high speed to separate heavy materials in a substance from lighter materials in the same substance. The heavier particles will clump at the bottom and form a pellet, while the solution above the pellet is referred to as the supernatant. Centrifuge speeds are measured in RPM (revolutions per minute) or RCF (relative centrifugal force; often referred to as ‘g-force’). Like all other centrifuges, laboratory centrifuges work by the sedimentation principle, where the centripetal acceleration is used to separate substances of greater and lesser density. Microcentrifuges sit on the bench top and are used to spin small (2 mL or less) liquid samples at high speeds (up to tens of thousands times g-force). Centrifugation of small samples is important for many biological applications, such as pelleting nucleic acids or proteins from solution. Generally, we also use “microcenfuges” to gather the typically very small volumes of liquids that we work with into the bottom of the tube. All centrifuges must be balanced or they will be unstable and will not spin at the correct speed. To balance a centrifuge, tubes are symmetrically arranged around the center. An odd number of tubes can be balanced with empty tubes or “balance” tubes filled with water (always label the ALL tubes appropriately). It is a good practice to tubes always place the tubes in the centrifuge such that the hinges face outward. This way, you will know that the pellet forms directly below the hinge of the microcentrigue tube which helps when the pellet is small and difficult to see. 6.3.1 Experimental procedures Obtain an empty microcentrifuge tube. Label your tube. Transfer 200 µL of xxx to the microcentrifuge tube. Put your tubes into the centrifuge with the hinge facing outward. Make sure that the centrifuge is properly balanced. Spin the tubes at 10,000 rpm for 30 seconds, Use a pipette to transfer the supernatant to a new tube, being sure to leave the pellet untouched. Eject the tip into container provided for discarded tubes, by pressing the tip ejector button. Show your instructor the two tubes - one with supernatant, one with the silica resin pellet. Your instructor will keep the tube with the silica resin. Discard the tube with the supernatant. 6.4 Review Questions "]
